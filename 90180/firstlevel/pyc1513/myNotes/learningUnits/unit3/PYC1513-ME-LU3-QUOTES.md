# Exploring how to establish shared togetherness
# Introduction
>In this  learning  unit, we explore how to establish shared togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1624R|p.1]]

>Consultation is  about  interactions between a consultant and a  client [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1627R|p.1]]

>Interaction means that both the consultant and the client execute actions  in the consultation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1630R|p.1]]

>They  learn from their actions by reflecting on and conceptualising the experiences that result from their actions. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1633R|p.1]]

>Learning occurs in between actions. It is important that learning occurs because without learning the consultation process cannot progress [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1636R|p.1]]

>when we say that learning occurs in between actions we talk about the actions of the consultant  or  the actions of the client. In other words, we consider the actions of the consultant and the actions of the client separately [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1639R|p.1]]

>Interaction means there must be some relationship between the actions of the consultant and those of the client. Thus,  we must think of their actions as reactions  to  each other’s actions. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1642R|p.1]]

>Remember, the action of accepting is a reaction to  the other person’s action of presenting [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1645R|p.1]]

>When  we  say  that  learning  occurs  in  the  interaction between  the  consultant  and the client,  we mean that learning  occurs  between  the  consultant  accepting  the client’s presentation and presenting their own presentation in return [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1648R|p.1]]

>Similarly,  learning occurs  between the client accepting the consultant’s presentation and presenting a presentation of their own  in return. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1651R|p.1]]

>learning [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=1&annotation=1654R|p.1]] occurs  when  the  consultant  processes  the  client’s presentation, and when the client processes the consultant’s presentation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1657R|p.2]]

>It is also about establishing a togetherness that is shared by the consultant and the client. It is about finding  common  ground  and  creating  a  shared understanding of themselves and their world, which  is the goal of consultation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1660R|p.2]]

>Consultation  is  a  process  of  establishing  shared togetherness to find common ground [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1663R|p.2]]

>psychological intervention is a way of being together [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1666R|p.2]]

The purpose of this learning unit is:
>to explore a theoretical perspective  of how shared togetherness is established and how learning occurs  between accepting somebody else’s presentation and presenting a presentation of one’s own. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1669R|p.2]]

At the end of this learning unit, you should be able to:
> - describe  how  interaction  leads  to  shared togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1672R|p.2]]
> - Assess  how  interactions  relate  to  information processing [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1675R|p.2]]
> - explain  how  information  processing  relates  to cognitive processes [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1678R|p.2]]
> - Appraise  how  cognitive  processes  relate  to correlating actions in consultations [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1681R|p.2]]

# Key concepts
>consultation, togetherness, shared togetherness, entangled interactions,  interlinked  actions,  correlated  actions, concept  of  information,  dimensions  of  information, processing  of  information,  perceiving  of  information, intuition in interaction, imagination in interaction, logic in interaction, problem-solving in interaction [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1684R|p.2]]

# Sharing togetherness to find common ground
>Generically,  consultation consists of interactions between a consultant and a client. The consultant and the client aim to establish shared togetherness and find common ground through  their  interactions. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=2&annotation=1687R|p.2]]

>All interactions in consultation are about presenting and accepting  information.  The  consultant  and  the  client interlink and correlate their actions of  presenting and accepting. They process information between accepting the other’s presentation and presenting one of their own. They process information through intuition, imagination, logic and  problem-solving,  which  means  consultation  is primarily about being intuitive, imaginative, logical, and focused on problem-solving [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1690R|p.3]]

>The goal of consultation is to establish shared togetherness to  find  common  ground,  which  means  neither  the consultant nor the client is intitled to enforce their view of togetherness upon the other and colonise the common ground they look for. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1693R|p.3]]

# Togetherness is a basic human condition
>“You are born alone, and you die alone”. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1696R|p.3]]

>These are ugly words, and a nasty warning. When somebody tells you that you are born alone and that you die alone, they are warning you not to rely too much on other people because in the final instance you are likely to be alone. But these words are not true. We are with  our mother when we are born, and most of us are born into a family that cannot wait to welcome us. We do not know what happens when we die, but our narratives about dying are about being united with others, be that our ancestors, or angels, or a god, or being reincarnated back into this world. Therefore, even in birth and death we do not imagine ourselves alone [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1699R|p.3]]

>We may be biological singletons but psychologically we cannot survive without others. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1702R|p.3]]

>The point is that togetherness is a basic human condition. Our wellness depends on the quality of the togetherness we [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=3&annotation=1705R|p.3]] share with others. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1708R|p.4]]

>We become lonely and isolated when we cannot find common ground with others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1711R|p.4]]

# We use high-level cognitive functions to establish togetherness
>Togetherness is not a passive process. We actively create togetherness with others by presenting ourselves to them and accepting what they present of themselves. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1714R|p.4]]

>We present ourselves through our behaviour and we accept what others present  of  themselves  by  observing  their  behaviour. Sometimes we behave intuitively, but there are also times when we think carefully about our behaviour. We need to observe and interpret the behaviour presented by others, and we need to plan and execute our own behaviour following  appropriate  social  rules. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1717R|p.4]]

>This  means  that establishing  togetherness  requires  high-level  brain functions, such as perception, recognition, thinking and planning. These are called cognitive functions [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1720R|p.4]]

>Cognition is our ability to execute high-level brain functions [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1723R|p.4]]

>There are four cognitive functions are fundamental to the ways in which we establish and maintain togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1726R|p.4]]

>These are intuition, imagination, logic and problem-solving. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1729R|p.4]]

>We use these functions in our everyday interactions with other people. We also use them when we consult with others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1732R|p.4]]

# Self-assessment activity
>At the end of this  learning  unit is a list of  articles/resources on  togetherness.  Read  the  article  by  Van  Oers  and Hännikäinen entitled:  Some thoughts about togetherness. It can be accessed at the link provided in the reference. After reading the article, critically reflect on the importance of fostering an orientation of togetherness as early as possible. If togetherness is a basic human condition, why do we not always  find  it  appealing?  Share  your  views  on  the discussion forum. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1735R|p.4]]

# Consultation is a form of being together
>The process of consultation is just one of many ways in which we can be together with others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1738R|p.4]]

>We often think of consultation as a special process in which a consultant helps a client to resolve an issue [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1741R|p.4]]

>We forget that fundamentally consultation is a way of being together. We miss the point that togetherness is a necessary condition for consultation and that we cannot have consultation without togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=4&annotation=1744R|p.4]]

# We use generic notation to describe togetherness as a universal human condition
>We use generic notation to describe what the cognitive processes of  our togetherness look like fundamentally [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1747R|p.5]]

>Generic notation simply means  that we enclose fundamental terms in square brackets [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1750R|p.5]]

# From interacting to sharing togetherness
>We live in a world that we think is real and objective. We think it is real because it is a reality that we cannot change, and we think it is objective because this reality is the same for everybody. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1753R|p.5]]

>However, strange as this may sound, there is no way to  prove  that the world is real and objective. We only have our individual perspectives of this world, and these perspectives are subjective. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1756R|p.5]]

# Togetherness begins with interactions
>We establish togetherness through interacting with others. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1759R|p.5]]

>We do this by presenting information and accepting information presented by others. But this interaction is personal because the actions of presenting and accepting are done by the same person. This means our perspectives of togetherness are personal and subjective [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1762R|p.5]]

>In consultation, we need to bring the personal and subjective perceptions of the consultant and the client together to establish shared togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1765R|p.5]]

>Finding common ground in shared togetherness is a necessary condition for consultation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=5&annotation=1768R|p.5]]

# My interaction
>I must interact with others to establish togetherness with them [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1771R|p.6]]

>I do this by presenting myself and accepting what they present of themself. In generic terms,  this means [I] establish togetherness with [You] when [I] present myself and accept a presentation from [You] [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1774R|p.6]]

>Note that our presentations are evidence of our behaviour [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1777R|p.6]]

>We provide evidence of our behaviour by  presenting ourselves in person physically or virtually. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1780R|p.6]]

>This means our behaviour is observable [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1783R|p.6]]

>However, the direct observation of behaviour is not the only form of evidence of behaviour. We also find evidence of behaviour in verbal and written descriptions  of  behaviour.  Furthermore,  written documents, graphic illustrations and drawings provide evidence  of  our  thoughts  and  ideas,  in  other  words, evidence of our thinking behaviour. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1786R|p.6]]

>Also note that accepting a presentation is about observing the presentation  and taking it on board. This is not about agreeing or disagreeing with the presentation. It is only in reflecting on a presentation that one comes to agree or disagree with the presentation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1789R|p.6]]

# Your interaction
>The generic description of establishing togetherness is also true for the other person, the person I interact with. From their  perspective  they  may  also  say:  [I]  establish togetherness with [You] when [I] present myself and accept a presentation from [You]. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1792R|p.6]]

# Our interaction
>Therefore,  we  have  two  interactions  of  establishing togetherness,  and  both  are  equally  true.  Both  are interactions of establishing togetherness between us. In generic  terms  we  can  write  this  as:  [We]  establish togetherness with [Us] when [We] present ourselves and accept presentations from [Us]. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1795R|p.6]]

>However, the togetherness we establish is not the sum of the togetherness established by me and the togetherness established by you. It is the togetherness we share. It is the common ground created by our interactions of establishing togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=6&annotation=1798R|p.6]]

There are two perspectives when we establish our togetherness:
>[I] establish our togetherness from my perspective, and [You] establish our togetherness from your perspective. I cannot know our togetherness from your  perspective, and you cannot know it from my perspective. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1801R|p.7]]

>We create common ground in our togetherness through a process  called entanglement. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1804R|p.7]]

>To entangle means to interlink and correlate. Thus, things are entangled when they are interlinked and correlated. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1807R|p.7]]

# Shared togetherness comes from entangled interactions
>We interlink our respective interactions of establishing togetherness by taking turns in a serial process through which  we  establish  togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1810R|p.7]]

>In  other  words, generically speaking, we execute the following actions: [I] present => [You] accept my presentation => [You] present => [I] accept your presentation => [I] present => [You] accept my presentation => [You] present, and so forth [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1813R|p.7]]

>our interactions are interlinked [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1816R|p.7]]

>However, apart from interlinking our interactions, we also need to ensure that our actions are correlated [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1819R|p.7]]

>In other words, we must  make sure that each action in the series of actions correlates to the preceding action [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=7&annotation=1822R|p.7]]

>My  perspective of our togetherness and your perspective of our togetherness get entangled when we establish a chain of correlated actions, taking turns in a serial process of establishing togetherness. This is the basic process of consultation. Sharing togetherness and finding common ground in our togetherness is the condition for and the primary goal of any consultation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=8&annotation=1825R|p.8]]

# Shared togetherness and consultation
>correlating actions is  a process that must be explored in more detail. Correlating what one presents to somebody with what one accepts from them involves information processing [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1828R|p.9]]

Therefore, we must explore how:
> - interactions  relate to information processing [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1831R|p.9]]
> - information  processing relates to mental faculties (cognitive processes) [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1834R|p.9]]
> - mental  faculties (cognitive  processes) relate to correlating actions in consultation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1837R|p.9]]

# Self-assessment activity
>In Learning Unit 4, you are introduced to a number of theoretical approaches to psychological intervention, one of which is family therapy. One approach to family therapy is known as Bowenian Family Therapy, named after its developer, Murray Bowen. Bowen’s  theory focuses on the balance of togetherness and individuality. While Bowen talks about  this balance in terms of the relationship between various  members  of  a  family  that  presents  for psychological intervention, think of this in terms of the relationship between the therapist and the client. Do you think there is a need to maintain this balance in the therapeutic  relationship?  Why/why  not?  Share  your thoughts on the discussion forum [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1840R|p.9]]

# Interactions relate to information processing
>I process information when I create my presentation. This means I export the information that I possess internally in the form of a presentation. In other words, I externalise internal information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1843R|p.9]]

>When I accept a presentation, I import existing information and reflect on it internally. This means I process information by internalising information that exists externally [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1846R|p.9]]

>When the information that I internalise relates  to  the  information  that I externalise, I relate (correlate) my action of accepting information with my action of presenting information [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1849R|p.9]]

>I am congruent when there is a strong correlation between the information I accept and the information I present [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1852R|p.9]]

>The process is similar for you, and we can conclude that you are congruent when there is a strong correlation between the information you accept and the information you present [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=9&annotation=1855R|p.9]]

>We experience each other’s congruence in our interactions when we accept and reflect on each other’s presentations [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1858R|p.10]]

>If I am congruent, the information that I present correlates to the information that I accept and therefore the information that I present relates to the information that you presented [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1861R|p.10]]

>Because this process is similar for you, we can conclude that  I  know  you  are  congruent  when  I  accept  your presentation  and  realise  that  it  relates  to  my  earlier presentation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1869R|p.10]]

# The concept of information
>We understand what it means to have information about  something, but when asked what information is, we  struggle to produce an answer. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1872R|p.10]]

>We can define information as the meaning contained in a differentia [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1875R|p.10]]

>A differential is a difference between things. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1878R|p.10]]

>Information is the meaning contained in a differential [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1881R|p.10]]

### The dimensions of information
>A differential is a difference between two things. These [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=10&annotation=1884R|p.10]] things can be concrete physical  objects and events, or they may be abstract concepts and processes, which means information is obtained from either concrete or abstract situations. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1887R|p.11]]

>Existing  things  establish  differences between  them,  thus  creating  information,  whereas differentiating  things  means  differences  are  used  to distinguish things, thus relying on existing information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1890R|p.11]]

>The definition that we adopted above means we must consider information in terms of two dimensions, one being how we perceive information and the other being how we process information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1893R|p.11]]

>We perceive information as concrete or abstract, and we process information by producing information or by relying on existing information [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1896R|p.11]]

### The dimensions of processing information
>Our interactions are about interlinking  and correlating actions of presenting information and actions of accepting information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1899R|p.11]]

>Presenting  and  accepting  information  are  actions  of information processing, but we cannot execute both at the same time. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1902R|p.11]]

>Because we cannot simultaneously present and accept information, we must consider them as separate processes on the dimension of information processing [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=11&annotation=1905R|p.11]]

# Information processing relates to mental faculties (cognitive processes)
>Our mental abilities result from our inherent perceptual and cognitive powers  that  are called mental faculties [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=12&annotation=1908R|p.12]]

>Cultural and subject disciplinary contexts determine how mental faculties are named, defined, and understood, resulting in various, different perspectives [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=12&annotation=1911R|p.12]]

>mental faculties, which we call intuition, imagination, logic and problem-solving. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1914R|p.13]]

![[90180/firstlevel/pyc1513/myNotes/learningUnits/unit3/attachments/image-2.png]]

>The mental faculties or cognitive processes of intuition, imagination,  logic  and  problem-solving  are  how  we process  information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1917R|p.13]]

>We  process  information  through acting or reflecting. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1920R|p.13]]

>we use intuition when we act on experiential information to present intuitive behaviour, and we  use  problem-solving  when  we  act  on  conceptual information to present problem-solving behaviour. We use imagination when we accept and reflect on experiential information, and we use logic when  we accept and reflect on conceptual information [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1923R|p.13]]

>Our  experiences  contain information,  and  we  process  this  information  using intuition. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1926R|p.13]]

>we  process  experiential information  through  intuition  to  present  intuitive behaviour. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=13&annotation=1929R|p.13]]

>We experience a world that consists of thoughts and ideas. These ideas are called concepts. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=14&annotation=1932R|p.14]]

>The thought process we use to formulate concepts is called conceptualisation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=14&annotation=1935R|p.14]]

>we use our mental faculty of problem-solving when we act on conceptual information and present problem-solving behaviour [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=14&annotation=1938R|p.14]]

>Reflecting on experiential information means we accept the awareness and feelings associated with the experience and speculate about what these could mean. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=14&annotation=1941R|p.14]]

>We imagine possible meanings. In other words, we use our mental faculty of imagination when we reflect on experiential information [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=14&annotation=1944R|p.14]]

>Reflecting on our conceptualisations means we  make  logical  inferences  based  on our  conceptual understandings [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=15&annotation=1947R|p.15]]

>In other words, we use our mental faculty of logic when we reflect on conceptualisations. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=15&annotation=1950R|p.15]]

# Mental faculties relate to correlating actions in consultation
>Consultation requires shared togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=16&annotation=1953R|p.16]]

>We establish shared togetherness through interlinking and correlating our  actions  of  accepting  and  presenting  information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=16&annotation=1956R|p.16]]

>However, this information is experiential and conceptual. Therefore, our actions of accepting and presenting are actions  of  accepting  and  presenting  experiential information  and  actions  of  accepting  and  presenting conceptual information. Thus,  there are various ways to establish togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=16&annotation=1959R|p.16]]

>When we express this generic description in terms of the cognitive processes that we employ to process information, we see that the first action becomes: [I] present [intuitive behaviour], or [I] present [problem-solving behaviour]. Similarly, the second action becomes: [You] accept and reflect on my presentation  [imaginatively] or [You] accept and reflect on my presentation [logically].

When we link these actions, we get four potential interactions:
>- [I] present [intuitive behaviour]: =>  [You]  accept  and  reflect  on  my  presentation [imaginatively] 
>- [I] present [intuitive behaviour]: => [You] accept and reflect on my presentation [logically] 
>- [I] present [problem-solving behaviour]: =>  [You]  accept  and  reflect  on  my  presentation [imaginatively] 
>- [I] present [problem-solving behaviour]: => [You] accept and reflect on my presentation

>The possible ways in which we establish togetherness grow exponentially with each interaction between you and me [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=17&annotation=1968R|p.17]]

>There is a very important lesson to be learnt here. If there are endless ways in which we  can be together, why do we insist on enforcing our ways of togetherness upon others? [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=17&annotation=1971R|p.17]]

# Self-assessment activities
>1.  The  issue  of  togetherness  raises  several  important issues, particularly for you as student. In the first instance, you are a studying at a distance learning institution where psychical interaction with other students and lecturers  is limited. In the second  instance,  all of us  had  to  contend with various degrees of  lock down and  social distancing  for more than two years.  Given that togetherness is a basic human condition, how did this impact you? How do you [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=20&annotation=1974R|p.20]] think this impacted those who required psychological intervention? Share your experiences and views on the discussion forum [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=21&annotation=1977R|p.21]]
>2. In the list of resources below is an article by Bakardjieva entitled:  Virtual  togetherness:  an  everyday-life perspective. It  can be accessed at the link provided in the reference. Read the article and relate it to the issues above. Do  you think virtual togetherness fully compensates for the lack of physical togetherness imposed on us during Covid, and you even more  so  as a student  at  a distance learning institution? Also, critically reflect on these issues within the context of psychological intervention and share your views on the discussion forum [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=21&annotation=1980R|p.21]]

# Summary
>we established that togetherness is a basic human condition and  discussed  the importance of high-level cognitive functions to establish togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=21&annotation=1983R|p.21]]

>In  psychological  intervention,  the  interactions constitute the consultation process, which is a  process of establishing shared togetherness to find common ground [[PYC1513-2025-LU-3.pdf#page=21&annotation=1986R|p.21]]
