# The dynamics of togetherness
### Introduction
>We cannot exist totally separate and isolated from others. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1385R|p.1]]

>We are fundamentally connected, and we experience our connectedness as togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1388R|p.1]]

The purpose of this learning unit is to:
> - introduce the structure and dynamics of togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1391R|p.1]]
> - introduce the cultural dynamics of togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1394R|p.1]]

>we are introduced to the dynamics of togetherness as the interconnectedness of three components, namely [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1397R|p.1]][[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1397R|p.1]]
>- We
>- You and
>- I

>These components and their interconnections constitute the structure of togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1400R|p.1]]

After working through this learning unit, you should be able to:
> - Define the concept togetherness and it the interconnected components [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1403R|p.1]]
> - Evaluate the cultural dynamics of togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1406R|p.1]]
> - Appraise the concept togetherness in the context of psychological intervention [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1409R|p.1]]
> - Apply ethical decisions and behavior in various contexts [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1412R|p.1]]
> - Assess the ontological value of I and from a decolonial perspective [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1415R|p.1]]

>The following key concepts are introduced in this learning unit: togetherness; generic terminology; ontology; [We], [You] and [I] in the context of togetherness; horizontal and [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=1&annotation=1418R|p.1]] vertical interconnections; decoloniality; individualism; and collectivism [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1421R|p.2]]

# The generic terminology of togetherness
>We know we experience togetherness when we feel connected to others. Although this seems like a plausible explanation of togetherness, it does not tell us exactly what togetherness is. It relates the experience of togetherness to a feeling of connectedness, which means it links togetherness to connectedness, and it describes togetherness as an experience and connectedness as a feeling, but it does not tell us exactly what this experience and feeling resemble [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1424R|p.2]]

>A fundamental reality is called an ontology. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1427R|p.2]]

>we must choose our words carefully and be precise when we talk about togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1430R|p.2]]

>A statement that is expressed in its most basic form, is a generic statement. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1433R|p.2]]

>we write [We], [You] and [I] instead of we, you and I when we use them as generic terms. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1436R|p.2]]

>The generic statement that [We] experience togetherness when [You] and [I] feel interconnected offers generic formulations of experiences of togetherness in various contexts by replacing the contextually appropriate terms with the generic terms of [We], [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=2&annotation=1439R|p.2]] [You] and [I]. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1442R|p.3]]

>Generic terminology allows one to understand a phenomenon (like togetherness) regardless of the various contexts in which it occurs [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1445R|p.3]]

>Generic terminology also allows one to describe situations in which one phenomenon is fundamental to another in various contexts [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1448R|p.3]]

>not only does generic terminology allow one to transfer one’s understanding from one context to another, it also allows one to translate one’s understanding from one phenomenon to another [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1451R|p.3]]

>we translate the generic terms of [Consultant] and [Client] to the generic terms of [We], [You] and [I]. This is a process of connecting generic terms [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1454R|p.3]]

>Therefore [I] is the [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=3&annotation=1457R|p.3]] ontological term for [Consultant], and [You] is the ontological term for [Client]. I [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=4&annotation=1460R|p.4]]

# The structure and dynamics of togetherness
>The generic terms [We], [You] and [I] are the names of three components of togetherness, namely a we component, a you component and an I component. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=4&annotation=1463R|p.4]]

>These components are abstract. They embody we-ness, you-ness and I-ness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=4&annotation=1466R|p.4]]

>Togetherness is structured ontologically as three interconnected components called [We], [You] and [I]. The interconnections between [We] and [I], and [We] and [You] are vertical. The interconnection between [I] and [You] is horizontal. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=4&annotation=1469R|p.4]]

>The diagram in figure 2.1 shows the three generic terms [We], [You] and [I] as well as arrows depicting the interconnections among them [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=4&annotation=1472R|p.4]]

>Together, the two connections form a unity called an interconnection [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1475R|p.5]]

>Interconnections are symmetrical or asymmetrical depending on whether the connections they consist of are supplementary or non-supplementary. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1478R|p.5]]

>Connections are supplementary when they work together to constitute an integrated and cohesive unity. For example, the connections between [I] and [You] are supplementary when both [I] and [You] present themselves and fully accommodate each other’s presentations, creating an integrated and cohesive interconnection. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1481R|p.5]]

>Integrated and cohesive interconnections are symmetrical. Not presenting oneself or not accommodating the presentations offered by others means nonsupplementary connections and consequently poorly integrated and low cohesive interconnections. These interconnections are asymmetrical. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1484R|p.5]]

>We  also  distinguish  between  horizontal  and  vertical interconnection [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1487R|p.5]]

>An interconnection is horizontal when the interconnected components are at the same level, and vertical when the interconnected components are at different levels [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1490R|p.5]]

>However, a structural view is a static picture, like a still photo. It does not tell us how the components and interconnections in the image change. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1493R|p.5]]

>But in togetherness, neither the interconnections nor the components are rigid and unchanging. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1496R|p.5]]

>Any interaction that occurs between components changes their interconnection as well as the components themselves. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=5&annotation=1499R|p.5]]

>A story that runs smoothly from beginning to end is a linear story, but a story that changes in unexpected ways is nonlinear. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1502R|p.6]]

[[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1505R|p.6]]

# The ethics of togetherness
>Ethics is a  complex  topic because part of it always escapes our attempt to understand it rationally,  but this does not mean that we should give up on ethics. A togetherness that does not strive to be ethical is  not  worthwhile to pursue. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1508R|p.6]]

>Togetherness is about interaction. It is about the act of presenting oneself and the act of accommodating the presentations of others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1511R|p.6]]

>In other words, it  is about the interconnection between [I] and [You] and in particular the symmetry of this interconnection. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1514R|p.6]]

>If the connections do not supplement each other,  they do not  constitute  integrated  and  cohesive  interconnections [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1522R|p.6]]

>However,  supplementary  connections  that  constitute  an integrated  and  cohesive  interconnection  are  not  necessarily ethical [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1525R|p.6]]

>In other words, the symmetry of the interconnection between [I] and [You] does not guarantee the ethics of the interconnection. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1528R|p.6]]

>The only guarantee for ethical togetherness is the authenticity of [We]. [We] is authentic when it feels right, when it is congruent with who we are and what we want to be. This is where ethics slips beyond rational understanding. We can have a rational discussion about the symmetry of the interconnection between  [I] and [You], but our understanding of the authenticity of [We] is a feeling that goes beyond rationality. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1531R|p.6]]

>We devise rational ethical rules to regulate the interconnection between [I] and [You], but these rules and regulations are always relative to the  authenticity [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=6&annotation=1534R|p.6]] of [We]. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1537R|p.7]]

>The ultimate test for ethical togetherness is whether our togetherness  is  congruent  with  what  we  see  as  authentic existence [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1540R|p.7]]

# Togetherness and the culture of our existence
>These interconnections are characterized as ‘We are because I am’, ‘I am because we are’, and ‘I become you’. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1543R|p.7]]

>The dynamics of togetherness are associated with object, relational and trace ontologies and the values of individualism, collectivism and decoloniality [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1546R|p.7]]

>A person’s styles of thinking, their ways of interacting, and their views of the world are functions of their cultural contexts, but also the source of culture [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1549R|p.7]]

>A person’s style of thinking, ways of interacting and views of the world influence their togetherness with others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1552R|p.7]]

>For some their culture suggests that ‘we are because I am’, whereas for others ‘I am because we are’. There are also those who embrace their togetherness as ‘I  become you’. They are the ones who really know how  to  live  their  lives  in  the  current  era  of  4th  industrial decoloniality [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1555R|p.7]]

>We are because I am [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1558R|p.7]]

>A period of socio-cultural revival known as the Renaissance began around the 15th century CE in Europe. The people of that time emerged from an era dominated by feudal systems, medieval thinking,  and religious doctrine. Not surprisingly the Renaissance encouraged  such  values  as  humanism,  individualism,  and scepticism in reaction to the oppressions of former centuries. People looked at themselves as human beings, as individuals who [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=7&annotation=1561R|p.7]] had the right to question the world and to be sceptical about the social institutions that organised their existence [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=8&annotation=1564R|p.8]]

>They rejected mysticism and put their trust in objective science [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=8&annotation=1567R|p.8]]

>The Western world adopted an object  ontology with individualism as a core value. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=8&annotation=1570R|p.8]]

>The statement “We are because I  am’  implies  a  particular  kind  of  togetherness [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=8&annotation=1573R|p.8]]

>Given an object ontology [We], [You] and [I] are viewed as objects that exist in their own right. But subscribing to the value of individualism means the [I] component is considered to be more prominent than the [We] and [You] components. Therefore, [I] has dominant connections with [We] and [You] (indicated by solid arrows), whereas the connections from [We] to [I] and from [You] to [I] are subordinate connections (indicated by dashed arrows). Thus, the connections between [I] and [We] are not supplementary and neither are those between [I] and [You]. Non-supplementary connections constitute interconnections that are poorly integrated and have low cohesion. Such interconnections are asymmetrical. However, unlike the asymmetrical interconnections between [I] and [We] and [I] and [You] the interconnection between [We] and [You] is symmetrical. It consists of two supplementary, yet subordinate, connections that work together to form an integrated and cohesive interconnection. The connections are subordinate due  to both [We] and [You] being considered less important than [I], and they are supplementary because neither [I] nor [You] is considered more important than the other [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=8&annotation=1576R|p.8]]

>The [Individualist] [I] presents themself but is not willing to fully accommodate what others [You] have to offer. Similarly, the [Individualist] dominates the idea of who [We] are but is less likely to subscribe to who [We] are.  Finally,  the  [Individualist]  imagines  the  interconnection between [We] and [You] but is not interested in exploring  it for real [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=9&annotation=1579R|p.9]]

>We can express the general description of the actions of the generic [Individualist] at a personal level [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=9&annotation=1585R|p.9]]

>we see that in an object individualist ontology I consider myself largely as the central character. Everything is viewed and done from my perspective. I dictate what it means for us to be together. In our togetherness,  I maintain an asymmetrical relationship with you which means I present myself and my ideas to  you,  but I am less willing to learn about you and your ideas. I do not totally ignore you as a person in your own  right,  but I am only prepared to accept what you present as far as it can be accommodated within my own views. I also maintain an asymmetric relationship with the idea of us, dictating who we are but only willing to commit to a joint vision of us in so far as this vision fits my own vision of us. I can imagine how you relate  to who we are, but I do not care to explore  the  interconnection  between  yourself  and  our  joint identity. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=9&annotation=1582R|p.9]]

>To consider togetherness in the context of psychological intervention,  we place the consultant in the position of I and the client in the position of  you. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=9&annotation=1588R|p.9]]

>Then we see that in an object individualist ontology the consultant considers themself largely as the central character. Everything is viewed and done from the consultant’s perspective. The consultant dictates what it means for the consultant and the  client to be together.

The consultant does not totally ignore the client as a person in their own right but the consultant is only prepared to accept what the client presents as far as it can be accommodated within the consultant’s own views. The consultant also maintains [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=9&annotation=1591R|p.9]] an asymmetric relationship with the  consultant-client union, dictating what the consultant-client union is but only willing to commit to a consultant-client union in so far as the union fits the consultant’s own idea of what the union is. The consultant can imagine how the client relates to the consultant-client union but does  not care to explore what this relationship is really like [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=10&annotation=1594R|p.10]]

>Relational ontology complements object ontology by focussing on the interconnection between components rather than the  components  themselves.  Relational  ontology  is  regularly associated  with  traditional  societies  in  which  the  group  is considered more important than the individual and in which the value of collectivism outweighs the value of individualism. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=10&annotation=1606R|p.10]]

>In threatening and demanding environments, it is easier to survive as a group than as an individual [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=10&annotation=1609R|p.10]]

>natural science such as physics  that  for  many centuries used to rely [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=10&annotation=1615R|p.10]] mainly on object ontology. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1618R|p.11]]

>We have a natural tendency to  think of objects first before considering how they relate to each other. It is difficult for us to think of an interrelationship from which objects emerge [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1621R|p.11]]

>For example, when asked to think about the relationship between yourself and somebody else you tend  to think of yourself and the other person before considering the relationship between the two of you. It is more difficult to think of the relationship first and to image the two of you emerging from this relationship. Yet this is the approach we must take  when exploring relational ontology. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1624R|p.11]]

>In  object  ontology,  objects  are  considered  primary  to interconnections, but in relational ontology interconnections are fundamental to objects. The [We] component articulates this distinction. In object ontology [I] and [You] are combined to constitute [We]. In relational ontology,  [We] is the interconnection from which [I] and [You] emerge. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1627R|p.11]]

![[90180/firstlevel/pyc1513/myNotes/learningUnits/unit2/attachments/image-2.png]]

>In relational ontology,  the [We] component is an interconnection. If  one  acknowledges  the  value  of  collectivism  in  relational ontology,  [We]  is  a  collective  interconnection [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1630R|p.11]]

>A  collective interconnection is a single, uniform interconnection from which two or more components emerge. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1633R|p.11]]

>Thus,  [We] is a single, uniform interconnection  from  which  the  [I]  and  [You]  components emanate. Each emerging object has a unique interconnection within  the  collective  interconnection. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1636R|p.11]]

>Therefore,  the interconnection between [We] and [I] is not the same as the interconnection between [We] and [You]. Because in relational ontology the [We] component is primary to  the [I] and [You] components,  [We] has dominant connections with [I] and [You] (indicated by solid arrows), whereas the connections from [I] to [We]  and  from  [You]  to  [We]  are  subordinate  connections (indicated by dashed arrows). The connections between [We] and [I] are not supplementary and neither are those between [We] and [You], which means both [I] and [You] emerge from asymmetrica [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=11&annotation=1639R|p.11]] interconnections. Note that in relational ontology there is no direct interconnection between [I] and [You] because [I] and [You] do not exist before the interconnection. They emerge from the interconnection. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=12&annotation=1642R|p.12]]

>We can use this ontological structure to describe the actions of the generic [Collectivist] in creating and maintaining togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=12&annotation=1645R|p.12]]

>Regardless of the nature of the [Collectivist] (e.g., person, group or society) there are generic ways in which the [Collectivist] interacts to create and maintain togetherness. The [Collectivist] emerges from the collective interconnection [We]. Although the [Collectivist] presents themself as a particular entity [I] the presentation is always subordinate to the dominant collective interconnection. As an entity,  the [Collectivist] is determined by the collective interconnection rather than being an entity in its own right. The [Collectivist] does  not present themself directly to other entities [You] and does  not directly accommodate what other entities have to offer, but instead imagines another entity [You] as another emergent from the collective interconnection [We]. As such,  [You]  presents  itself  as  a  particular  entity  but  the presentation  is  subordinate  to  the  dominant  collective interconnection. The imagined entity [You] is determined by the collective interconnection rather than being an entity in its own right. The interaction between the [Collectivist] and the imagined entity  [You]  is  not  direct.  It  is  mediated  by  the  collective interconnection [We].

>We can express the general description of the actions of the generic [Collectivist] at a personal level. To do so we put ourselves in the position of [I], consider others in the position of [You]  and define [We] as the relationship between us. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=12&annotation=1651R|p.12]]

>Then we see that in a relational collectivist ontology I define myself largely in terms of the relationship between you and me. Although I do not deny that I am a person in my own right,  I consider this to be less important and the relationship to be more prominent in determining who and what I am. I have a similar perspective of you. In my view,  you also consider yourself to be determined by the relationship rather than considering yourself to be a person in  your own right. I do not obtain  togetherness  by  presenting  myself  to  you  and  by accommodating what you present of yourself. Our togetherness is mediated by the relationship that we both draw on to define ourselves. Both of us contribute to this relationship but our contributions  are  subordinate  to  what  we  obtain  from  the relationship. You are what I perceive you to be (how I imagine you) based on how I relate to the relationship between us, and similarly I am what you imagine me to be based on how you relate [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=12&annotation=1654R|p.12]] to the relationship between us [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=13&annotation=1657R|p.13]]

>To  consider  togetherness  in  the  context  of  psychological intervention,  we place the consultant in the position of I and the client in the position of you. Then we see that in a relational collectivist ontology the consultant defines themself largely in terms of the professional relationship between the client and themself. Although the consultant does not deny that they are a person in their own right,  they consider this to be less important and  the  professional  relationship  to  be  more  prominent  in determining who and what they are as a  consultant. The consultant sees the client in the same way. In the consultant’s view,  the client also considers themself to be determined by the professional relationship rather than considering themself to be a person in their own  right.

>The second half of the 20th century is characterised by intellectual [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=13&annotation=1672R|p.13]] and political movements of decolonisation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=14&annotation=1675R|p.14]]

>colonialism is enabled, produced and perpetuated by the difference in powerfulness between the coloniser and the colonised, and racism is enabled, produced and perpetuated by differences in socio-economic power. But the most significant insight of  all was that knowledge itself is enabled, produced and perpetuated by power differentials [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=14&annotation=1678R|p.14]]

>We came to realise that what we know and how we know can be explored in terms of the power differentials in the political, socio-economic, and psychological spheres  of our lives. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=14&annotation=1681R|p.14]]

>The notion that we are because I am, clearly contains a power differential between ‘we’ and ‘I’.  In this statement ‘We’ and ‘I’ are not equally powerful. ‘I’ overpowers ‘we’, which allows the statement to express a particular truth, namely that we are because I am. The notion that I am because we are, contains a similar process. In this case,  ‘we’ overpowers ‘I’ and the statement expresses the truth that I am because we are. These statements are opposites [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=14&annotation=1684R|p.14]]

>the notion of reflection is becoming the basic reality of how we exist in this world and how we relate to others. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=15&annotation=1687R|p.15]]

>Reflection  is  about  continuation  as  well  as differentiation. When somebody looks in the mirror, they see a reflection of themself.  The person who looks in the mirror continues  to  exist  in  the  mirror  image. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=15&annotation=1690R|p.15]]

>Using  the  generic terminology of the ontology of togetherness, we can say [I] becomes [I] in the mirror image. However, the image is not an exact copy of the person in front of the  mirror. The continuation is also a differentiation. To begin with, there is the obvious fact that the image looks back at the person in front of the mirror. If it was an exact copy the image would have looked in the same direction as the person in front of the mirror, and the person would have seen the backside of themself. There is also the more intricate reality of the person in front of the mirror viewing the image from a personal perspective (as if looking from ‘inside’ themselves) obtaining an object  perspective, an outside view of themself. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=15&annotation=1693R|p.15]]

>On both accounts, reflection is a differentiation. The [I] in the mirror differs from the [I] in front of the mirror. Therefore [I] becomes [You] in the mirror image. In other words, [You] is [I] continued but different from itself. This is the essence of trace ontology [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=15&annotation=1696R|p.15]]

>[I] and [You], [We] and [I] and [We] and  [You].  There  are  no  subordinate  connections  in  these interconnections. All connections are  equally dominant, and they are  supplementary,  which  means  the  interconnections  are symmetrical. However, this also means that the components [I], [You] and [We] are complex. Firstly, they are components that interconnect, but they are also components that  emerge from their interconnections. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1699R|p.16]]

>In other words, each of the components have two states, a state of being and a state of emerging [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1702R|p.16]]

>Secondly, [I] and [You] are entangled due to the symmetry of the interconnection between  them.  This  simply  means  that  the  states  of  these components  cannot  be  considered  independently  from  one another. They are entangled [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1705R|p.16]]

>Thirdly, the superposition of these states is contained in [We]. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1708R|p.16]]

>A superposition of states means all possible combinations of the states involved are contained at once. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1711R|p.16]]

>There are four possible combinations of the states of [I] and [You], namely [I] in a state of being combined with [You] in a state of being, [I] in a state of emerging combined with [You] in a state of emerging, [I] in a state of being combined with [You] in a state of emerging, and finally [I] in a state of emerging combined with [You] in a state of being. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1714R|p.16]]

>Superposition means that [We] contains these four interconnections between [I] and [You] all at once. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1717R|p.16]]

>We can use this ontological structure to describe the actions of the generic [Decolonialist] in creating and maintaining togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1720R|p.16]]

>Regardless of the nature of the [Decolonialist] (e.g., person, group or society) there are generic ways in which the [Decolonialist] interacts to create and maintain togetherness. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1723R|p.16]]

>The [Decolonialist] is a complex  entity. It is an entity [I] that exists as a superposition of two states. It is simultaneously in a state of being and in a state of emerging. Its interaction with others is about disentanglement.  It  is  about  the  disentanglement  of  the superposition of its own states and the disentanglement of the [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=16&annotation=1726R|p.16]] superposition of states it shares with others. Disentangling the superposition of its own states means the [Decolonialist] collapses the superposition of its states into a particular state. For example, the [Decolonialist] may collapse the superposition of its states of being and emerging into the state of being. This means the [Decolonialist] takes the position that it is an existing [I] and not an emerging [I]. However, the collapse of the superposition of the [Decolonialist]’s states causes the collapse of the superpositions of the combinations of states in [We]. The superposition of the four combinations of states collapses into a superposition of two combinations, namely [I] in a state of being combined with [You] in a state of being, and [I] in a state of being combined with [You] in a state of emerging. Therefore, when the [Decolonialist] takes up a particular position the relationship, [We], between [I] and [You],  changes. In other words, the togetherness of  [I] and [You] changes. However, the [Decolonialist]’s position does not force [You] into a particular state. [You] remains in a superposition of existing and emerging. We come to the same conclusion when we examine what happens when the [Decolonialist] takes the position of emerging entity as opposed to existing entity. The bottom line is that the [Decolonialist] takes up different positions in their interactions with others,  but in doing so they do not force others to take up a particular position. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=17&annotation=1729R|p.17]]

>This  is  a  general  description  of  the  actions  of  the  generic [Decolonialist]. To see what this means at a personal level, we have to put ourselves in the position of [I], consider others in the position of [You] and define [We] as the relationship between us. Then we see that in a decolonial trace ontology I exist as a person in  my  own  right,  which  means I  can  assert  myself  in  my relationships with others. But I also exist as somebody who emerges from my relationships with others. The positions I adopt impact my  togetherness with others, but I never use my position to force others into adopting a particular position. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-2.pdf#page=17&annotation=1732R|p.17]]

>In the context of psychological intervention, the consultant takes the position of I and the client the position of you. Then we see that in decolonial trace ontology the consultant positions themself as an autonomous entity but at the same time as somebody who is defined by the relationship with the client. As such,  the consultant asserts themself in the intervention but also allows themself to be guided in the interaction with the client. The consultant uses these positions to manage their togetherness with the client but never uses these positions to force the client to adopt a particular position.
