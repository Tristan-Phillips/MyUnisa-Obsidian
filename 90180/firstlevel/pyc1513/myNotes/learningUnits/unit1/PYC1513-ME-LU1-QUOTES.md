# Introduction
>This module offers an introduction to psychological intervention based on historical and multicultural perspectives of the nature of human beings and practices of human interaction. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=352R|p.1]]

>It also explores how the various contexts of learning are brought together in the module. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=355R|p.1]] 
>It asserts that learning is embedded in multiple contexts
>	- it presents the information age

>A psychological intervention is an interaction informed and governed by some understanding of the nature of human beings. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=361R|p.1]]

>One cannot have an intervention without togetherness.  [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=364R|p.1]]

>The first stop along the route into psychological intervention is consultation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=367R|p.1]]

>Intervention is imbedded in consultation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=370R|p.1]]

>It is about the nature of psychological intervention in different cultural contexts, such as a traditional African context, an Eastern context, and a Western context [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=373R|p.2]]

>The second stop on your journey into psychological intervention is how interventions can be defined as psychological interventions in different cultural contexts. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=376R|p.2]]

>The third stop on your journey is consultant competence. Consultants decide on appropriate interventions and implement them. This means consultants need to be skilful in executing interventions and they need knowledge that support their interventions. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=379R|p.2]]

>The fourth stop is the final stop on your journey, which is referred to as intervention ethics. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=382R|p.2]]

>One needs extensive knowledge of psychology and intensive training to qualify as a psychological practitioner, and this module is the first step in this direction [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=385R|p.2]]

# Module Outcomes
This module comprises three broad learning outcomes. After completing this module, you should be able to:
> - Identify and assess the appropriateness of a psychological intervention, an agent of intervention and the role of the agent [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=388R|p.2]] of intervention in different historical, cultural and subject disciplinary contexts [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=391R|p.3]]
> - Identify cultural, societal and subject disciplinary structures and processes that formalise and legitimise psychological intervention [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=394R|p.3]]
> - Apply ethical principles and frameworks to assess the ethics of a psychological intervention [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=397R|p.3]]

# Learning in context
>Learning does not happen in isolation. It requires engagement with subject material and interaction with other people.  [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=400R|p.3]]

>When we select a particular learning opportunity, we do so because of our interests and needs, and these interests and needs are grounded in the contexts in which we exist [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=403R|p.3]]

>To learn means to acquire knowledge and skills that one did not possess before. Learning changes one’s understandings, including one’s interests and needs and impacts one’s views. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=406R|p.3]]

>If a learning opportunity does not take one beyond one’s current fields of knowledge and skills, it is not worth signing up for [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=409R|p.3]]

>Learning is rewarding or not rewarding. It is rewarding if it expands our interests and if it satisfies the needs we develop along the way [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=412R|p.4]]

>The problem with new learning is that we may not be quite sure how much we need the learning or how interesting it may turn out to be [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=415R|p.4]]

# The world as a learning context
>During the industrial age we favoured hierarchical organisation. We knew where and how we fitted in. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=418R|p.4]]

>But the information age brings a different kind of organisation. Former hierarchies are dismantled. We establish ourselves in networks that are dynamic and fluid, and in which our positions change regularly. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=421R|p.4]]

>We constantly need new knowledge and to acquire new skills for continually repositioning and redefining ourselves in an era that has become known as the fourth industrial revolution. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=424R|p.4]]

>The information age is an era that began in the mid-twentieth century with the advent of computer technology. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=427R|p.4]]

>Information became a more valuable commodity than the physical commodities traded on world markets, especially because it was fluid and flexible [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=430R|p.4]]

>fourth industrial revolution (4th IR) [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=433R|p.5]]

>The 4th IR is about cyber-physical systems. Cyber-physical systems are physical systems that incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence to show humanlike behaviour. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=436R|p.5]]

>The psychology of human cognition already plays an important role in the design and implementation of thinking machines but the area that increasingly expands psychology’s interest in the nature of humanity is the field of human-machine systems. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=439R|p.5]]

>These systems are about human-machine interactions and increasingly about interlinking biological bodies and physical machines. These are known as cyborg systems. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=442R|p.5]]

>the 4th IR is about incorporating technologies inside our bodies, and our bodies inside technologies [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=450R|p.5]]

>It is not about experiencing the world differently it is about existing differently in the world. In other words, it is less about experience and more about lived experience [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=453R|p.5]]

>The person forgets about the technology and ceases to think of themself as a person with artificial lenses. Instead, they think of themself as a person with a particular visual ability, as a person possessing a technique they deploy in enhancing their behaviour [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=456R|p.5]]

>the 4th IR is not simply about incorporating technology into our bodies. It is also about immerging ourselves into cyber-physical systems [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=459R|p.6]]

>We should also be mindful of the impact that the 4th IR will have on the environment. Central to this commitment is the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which calls on us to align our strategies and operations to the principles of a respect for human rights, fair labour, respect for the environment, and a commitment to anti-corruption. The UNGC consists of ten principles, with principle nine, in particular, emphasising the need to encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technologies [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=462R|p.6]]

>In this world, we are interconnected through exchanging information. On the one hand we are the sources producing the information we exchange, but on the other hand we are the products of the exchanged information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=465R|p.6]]

>The information age and the 4th IR not only change who we are and how we understand ourselves, they also constitute a significant force in democratising the world. They dismantle hierarchical and authoritarian systems through networks of interconnectedness and constant exchange of information. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=468R|p.6]]

>A world objecting to hierarchy and authority and interested in democratic systems is, by its very nature, deeply concerned about phenomenon like colonisation, decolonisation and decoloniality [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=471R|p.6]]

>Colonisation is the appropriation of a domain. The domain can be a physical space, but it can also be a set of ideas. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=474R|p.6]]

>When one country colonises another, it takes control of the other’s land, and it forces its ideas on the people of the colonised country. However, colonisation is not always this obvious. It can occur in subtle ways [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=477R|p.6]] and on a more personal scale [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=480R|p.7]]

>The student has a wealth of personal experience, but in these academic texts the student’s experiences are appropriated by psychological theory. Hence the student is led to understand themself and their world in terms of a colonising psychology. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=483R|p.7]]

>Decolonisation is the disappropriation of a colonised domain. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=486R|p.7]]

>Theoretically one may be tempted to think of decolonisation as the reverse of colonisation, but this does not work in practice [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=489R|p.7]]

>In practice, decolonisation cannot simply destruct what colonisation constructed [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=492R|p.7]]

>Therefore, if we are not careful colonisation and decolonisation may trap us in an endless cycle of repeated colonisation [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=500R|p.7]]

>Decoloniality is resistance to repeated colonisation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=503R|p.7]]

>The colonisation of experience by psychological theory rests on the presupposition that there is a difference between having an experience and thinking about the experience. In other words, we presuppose that experiences can be thought about and explained and based on this presupposition, we develop the idea that our explanations reveal the truth of our experiences and that some explanations are closer to the truth than others [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=506R|p.7]]

>However, it is not [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=509R|p.7]] correct to assume that a particular explanation of an experience reveals the real truth of the experience while another does not because there is no truth in the experience itself. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=512R|p.8]]

>An explanation does not uncover or reveal the truth of an experience, it constructs the truth of the experience. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=515R|p.8]]

>The truth of experience is not about how true an experience is or how truly it is explained. The truth of experience is offered by the presupposition that experience can be subjected to explanation, that it can be colonised. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=518R|p.8]]

>Decoloniality resists the truth of presuppositions [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=521R|p.8]]

>For example, it resists the fact that a person’s experience can be appropriated (colonised) by psychological explanation and it does so by maintaining that the inverse is also true, namely that psychological theory can be appropriated (colonised) by experience. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=524R|p.8]]

>In other words, from a decolonial perspective psychological explanation can be colonised by experience as much as experience can be colonised by psychological explanation. [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=527R|p.8]]

>In other words, if psychology can be used to understand what our experiences are and what they mean, it is equally true that our experiences can be used to understand what psychology is and what it means [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=530R|p.8]]

>In short, the discipline of psychology defines our experiences as much as our experiences define the discipline of psychology [[PYC1513-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=533R|p.8]]
