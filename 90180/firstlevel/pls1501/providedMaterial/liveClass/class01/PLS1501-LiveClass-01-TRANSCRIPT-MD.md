**Westman, Claire** : "Modules, so obviously our focus here is more on" : (00:00:04.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "the." : (00:00:09.573)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of beginnings of philosophy as we know them today," : (00:00:11.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "which is what we're going to focus on in this module," : (00:00:14.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "and you'll see how a lot of what we learn in this module ties into the other" : (00:00:17.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy modules that you might be doing now or that you might." : (00:00:22.083)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do in second or third year or in honors all of the sort of relates back to each" : (00:00:25.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "other." : (00:00:31.338)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this helps to give you a bit of a foundation for where for the beginnings" : (00:00:31.748)
**Westman, Claire** : "of philosophy as we know it today. And obviously if you're doing African" : (00:00:37.214)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy and you'll see in the beginning of the study guide there's a" : (00:00:42.395)
**Westman, Claire** : "lot of discussion around how Western philosophy has." : (00:00:47.506)
**Westman, Claire** : "Been." : (00:00:51.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "Privileged throughout history, and we've sort of as part of decolonizing" : (00:00:52.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "institutions moving towards." : (00:00:57.866)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or making a concerted effort to bring in more African philosophy and to move away" : (00:01:01.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "from strictly only focusing on Western philosophy." : (00:01:07.314)
**Westman, Claire** : "But a lot of the theoretical frameworks such as epistemology, metaphysics," : (00:01:11.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "ontology, they all sort of stem from the same place" : (00:01:17.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "or from from what you're going to learn in this module." : (00:01:22.427)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously they've changed and adapted over, you know, throughout time," : (00:01:27.658)
**Westman, Claire** : "but we're going to look at the the foundations of, particularly Greek," : (00:01:32.728)
**Westman, Claire** : "ancient Greek philosophy." : (00:01:37.528)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you've already seen my face. Some of you, for those who've just joined," : (00:01:39.498)
**Westman, Claire** : "let me just put my camera on for one second so you can see me. That's me." : (00:01:44.451)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm doctor Claire westman." : (00:01:49.538)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I am the module leader for the semester and then we also have Mr." : (00:01:51.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "Kala Bopape, who's the lecturer. He is in the meeting," : (00:01:56.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "so if he wants to turn on his camera so you can see him, he is welcome to." : (00:02:00.026)
**Westman, Claire** : "But otherwise we'll load picture of him as well." : (00:02:07.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then for this module, we also have a two markers who assist" : (00:02:12.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "with the assessments and the exams because this is a very large module." : (00:02:16.433)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we do have markers and then Mr. Poppy and I also of course do marking and" : (00:02:21.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "oversee the marking of the module." : (00:02:27.973)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please just note that in your tutorial letter it lists Professor Monguini as the" : (00:02:31.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "module leader, but he's on sabbatical at the moment," : (00:02:36.443)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I'm the acting module leader. So if you have any questions or concerns" : (00:02:39.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "or queries or you need to get in touch, please either e-mail me." : (00:02:44.556)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or Mr. bopape." : (00:02:48.708)
**Westman, Claire** : "Not Prof." : (00:02:50.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "Mongrini he is." : (00:02:51.158)
**Westman, Claire** : "He's on his research and development leave," : (00:02:52.998)
**Westman, Claire** : "so he is not working in the module at the moment." : (00:02:55.727)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please just take note of that if you have any questions." : (00:02:58.827)
**Westman, Claire** : "He has been forwarding me some emails from students who have been contacting" : (00:03:02.548)
**Westman, Claire** : "him." : (00:03:06.807)
**Westman, Claire** : "But all of our details are on the PLS1501 site." : (00:03:08.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you can easily get in touch with us if you need anything and a lot of students" : (00:03:14.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "have already been contacting me through the messaging." : (00:03:19.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "Platform on my unisa." : (00:03:24.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's great." : (00:03:25.278)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can e-mail." : (00:03:26.388)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or use that messaging platform." : (00:03:29.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or use the relevant discussion forums." : (00:03:30.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "We check them basically every day, so if you have any concerns," : (00:03:33.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "but obviously if it's more urgent concerns," : (00:03:38.825)
**Westman, Claire** : "please e-mail or use the messaging functionality on my unisa OK." : (00:03:42.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is the purpose of PLS 1501 and some of this is already in the tutorial" : (00:03:47.728)
**Westman, Claire** : "letter, so if you've worked through it then you" : (00:03:52.757)
**Westman, Claire** : "might have already seen some of this." : (00:03:55.813)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we're just going to have a bit of a chat about it." : (00:03:58.168)
**Westman, Claire** : "So obviously, as I've mentioned, this module's purpose is specifically to" : (00:04:01.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "introduce you to the history figures, problems and themes in Western philosophy." : (00:04:06.391)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, the focus is on Western philosophy," : (00:04:11.888)
**Westman, Claire** : "whereas in other modules you might be focusing on African philosophy and in" : (00:04:15.377)
**Westman, Claire** : "particular in this module amongst other figures," : (00:04:21.142)
**Westman, Claire** : "we're going to look primarily at Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine," : (00:04:24.858)
**Westman, Claire** : "and Psalm and Aquinas." : (00:04:30.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will see that they are also some other philosophers mentioned in the early" : (00:04:32.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "Greek ancient Greek philosophers." : (00:04:37.394)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I'm not going to list all of them." : (00:04:41.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "Make sure that you have read through the study guide and have begun to work" : (00:04:42.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "through that as you need to read through that in order to complete your assignment." : (00:04:48.745)
**Westman, Claire** : "So make sure that you please do that." : (00:04:55.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "And also some of the main themes we're going to look at and you'll get to know" : (00:04:58.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "these terms better. We won't focus on it too much today" : (00:05:03.064)
**Westman, Claire** : "because this is just an introduction, but some of the main themes we're going" : (00:05:06.116)
**Westman, Claire** : "to focus on are epistemology, metaphysics, political, Phil." : (00:05:10.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "And ethics." : (00:05:13.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we also want to help you develop an awareness of philos philosophical issues" : (00:05:15.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "in the academic environment, but also, very importantly," : (00:05:20.742)
**Westman, Claire** : "is to help you develop critical skills that you're going to use when you're" : (00:05:24.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "studying philosophical arguments. When you're evaluating philosophical" : (00:05:29.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "arguments." : (00:05:34.265)
**Westman, Claire** : "But then also thinking about how these skills apply to real life situations in" : (00:05:34.928)
**Westman, Claire** : "the world in which we live in your communities, in your lives. So." : (00:05:41.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "What's important is that you not think of philosophy as just a subject." : (00:05:47.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "That you're going to study here and never use again and it's going to have no value" : (00:05:52.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "for your studies or your life." : (00:05:56.658)
**Westman, Claire** : "The skills and the reasoning abilities that you're going to develop," : (00:05:58.548)
**Westman, Claire** : "the argumentation skills that you're going to develop are very necessary parts" : (00:06:03.111)
**Westman, Claire** : "of our lives, and in reading through the reflections" : (00:06:08.334)
**Westman, Claire** : "that some of you have done already on the site," : (00:06:11.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've seen some really good answers and some." : (00:06:15.013)
**Westman, Claire** : "Really." : (00:06:17.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "Good thinking around what you already know about philosophy." : (00:06:19.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you haven't done that already, I mean it's just for you to do as a" : (00:06:23.228)
**Westman, Claire** : "little extra exercise, but it's a great way for you to." : (00:06:28.502)
**Westman, Claire** : "Start the module to think about what do you know about philosophy." : (00:06:34.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "What does philosophy mean to you?" : (00:06:37.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "How is it going to help in your studies in your life?" : (00:06:39.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I've seen some really great responses, so I'm really excited to see that some of" : (00:06:42.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "you already have an idea of what philosophy is about, but more importantly," : (00:06:48.993)
**Westman, Claire** : "how many of you have noted that philosophy is an important part of our" : (00:06:54.674)
**Westman, Claire** : "everyday lives? So we engage in Phil." : (00:06:59.982)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thinking and philosophical reasoning without even realizing that we're doing" : (00:07:02.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "it most of the time so." : (00:07:07.898)
**Westman, Claire** : "Every day we engage in philosophical thought without knowing that you're doing" : (00:07:10.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "it." : (00:07:14.735)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then once we once you've been doing philosophy for a bit of time," : (00:07:15.078)
**Westman, Claire** : "once you've done this module while you're working through the module." : (00:07:18.813)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those critical thinking and reasoning skills are going to develop even further," : (00:07:24.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "and you're going to gain a greater awareness of how valuable philosophy and" : (00:07:29.138)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophical thinking is in everything you do." : (00:07:33.906)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it involves. Why do we make the choices we make?" : (00:07:36.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why do we have the beliefs that we have?" : (00:07:40.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "How do you gain knowledge of the world?" : (00:07:43.398)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can you understand the world and others better?" : (00:07:45.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is your place in the world?" : (00:07:49.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "And these might seem like a very big questions." : (00:07:53.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they can be." : (00:07:57.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "And often you will." : (00:07:58.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "You'll never might not ever get an specific answer to them." : (00:07:58.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "But the point is to be reflective to think about these things." : (00:08:02.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's so important because very often we make choices or we have beliefs," : (00:08:06.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "but we don't really think about why we make those choices or why we have those" : (00:08:11.228)
**Westman, Claire** : "beliefs or why we do the things that we do." : (00:08:16.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so philosophy fee is about think is about developing that reflective nature." : (00:08:20.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "That helps us to." : (00:08:28.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "Be more intentional about our thoughts and be more conscious of those choices we" : (00:08:31.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "make and of those decisions and of the ways we are in the world and the kinds of" : (00:08:37.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "things we the way we gain knowledge, the way we understand the world." : (00:08:43.381)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will see that the big questions and a lot of the times as you're doing" : (00:08:48.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy, sometimes you will see that your beliefs" : (00:08:54.035)
**Westman, Claire** : "and your opinions and your ideas and the way you think about yourself and the" : (00:08:57.647)
**Westman, Claire** : "world and others can start to change. And that's a." : (00:09:02.964)
**Westman, Claire** : "Good thing we all need to be reflective of who we are and how we behave and how" : (00:09:06.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "we act in this world, so hopefully that is something that" : (00:09:11.672)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're going to gain from this module." : (00:09:15.415)
**Westman, Claire** : "So philosophy can help to guide our well us to think about the questions." : (00:09:18.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "That guide our lives that can help us to think about the ways or reflect on the" : (00:09:25.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "ways in which we interact with others, the kinds of meaning we assign to our own" : (00:09:30.417)
**Westman, Claire** : "lives and the way in which we view not only our place in the world, but also." : (00:09:35.054)
**Westman, Claire** : "The value and meaning to be assigned to the world around us." : (00:09:39.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "So here you might even think about the meanings and value you assigned to" : (00:09:42.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "animals or to nature and the way you interact with that and the way you exist" : (00:09:47.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "in the world so." : (00:09:52.831)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're very, very big concept and big questions and" : (00:09:55.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "conflicts very complex at times and they can challenge your thinking." : (00:09:58.805)
**Westman, Claire** : "They can challenge the way." : (00:10:03.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "You feel about others the way you think about yourselves," : (00:10:07.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "about the meaning of your own life, but that is the whole point of philosophy," : (00:10:10.352)
**Westman, Claire** : "and that is what I hope that you're going to start to develop as you work through" : (00:10:14.592)
**Westman, Claire** : "this module." : (00:10:18.994)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yeah, I'm really glad that some of a lot of you" : (00:10:21.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "have already done the reflections. It's given me a good insight into where" : (00:10:23.994)
**Westman, Claire** : "you are at this point and what you already know and what you already think" : (00:10:27.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "about philosophy." : (00:10:31.866)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you for everyone that has done that. So specifically in this module," : (00:10:33.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "these are some of the questions we're going to ask." : (00:10:37.235)
**Westman, Claire** : "What can we know?" : (00:10:40.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "How do we gain knowledge?" : (00:10:41.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for example, some philosophers say that we knowledge" : (00:10:43.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "is only gained through rationality or using reason." : (00:10:47.731)
**Westman, Claire** : "Aristotle would say that it's through experience." : (00:10:51.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "So how do we get that knowledge?" : (00:10:56.108)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then we're also going to ask things like in terms of ethics," : (00:10:58.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "how do we know what is right and wrong?" : (00:11:01.677)
**Westman, Claire** : "How do we make decisions about that?" : (00:11:03.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is justice?" : (00:11:07.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "What form of government is best?" : (00:11:09.078)
**Westman, Claire** : "What does it mean to be a social animal?" : (00:11:10.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what does it mean to be a person in a social setting?" : (00:11:13.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "What does it mean to live in a world with others with nature, with?" : (00:11:17.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know, with animals, with ancestors, what does it just mean to be a person in" : (00:11:23.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "the world?" : (00:11:27.683)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are some of the main questions that we're going to ask as we work" : (00:11:28.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "through this module and I hope as I said that it's going to stimulate your own" : (00:11:33.615)
**Westman, Claire** : "thoughts and you're going to see how this relates to your life," : (00:11:39.025)
**Westman, Claire** : "to your everyday experiences, the quest." : (00:11:43.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "You have about the world, about your life, about others," : (00:11:46.388)
**Westman, Claire** : "and about how you are living." : (00:11:49.994)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the main outcomes, as we've already said," : (00:11:54.388)
**Westman, Claire** : "obviously one of the most important things that we need you to want you to" : (00:11:57.247)
**Westman, Claire** : "achieve by the end of the module is to understand the theoretical frameworks" : (00:12:02.013)
**Westman, Claire** : "that we will be looking at, such as epistemology, metaphysics, ethics," : (00:12:06.905)
**Westman, Claire** : "etcetera." : (00:12:11.416)
**Westman, Claire** : "And very, very very importantly, as a student," : (00:12:13.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "as a person in the world is to develop those critical thinking and reasoning" : (00:12:16.688)
**Westman, Claire** : "skills." : (00:12:21.226)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then by the end of the module, you will hopefully have enhanced your" : (00:12:22.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "skills for developing philosophical arguments," : (00:12:27.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "considering counter arguments and not just looking at one side of the argument." : (00:12:30.172)
**Westman, Claire** : "But it's always important to consider what the other side of the argument might" : (00:12:35.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "be." : (00:12:40.563)
**Westman, Claire** : "What might other people say about this idea or notion? How do these?" : (00:12:40.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "Interact with each other." : (00:12:48.278)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments," : (00:12:49.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "and how does that help you to reach a conclusion or to develop your own" : (00:12:53.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "argument and then obviously as you go through the module, you're going to?" : (00:12:57.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "Begin to understand and develop more complex arguments of your own by drawing" : (00:13:04.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "on those theoretical frameworks by drawing on research and doing the" : (00:13:09.778)
**Westman, Claire** : "readings throughout the module throughout the semester." : (00:13:14.360)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that is what the main things that we hope you're going to be able to achieve" : (00:13:18.888)
**Westman, Claire** : "by the time we reach the end of the semester." : (00:13:24.044)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in order to do that, it will be based on your readings on the" : (00:13:27.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignments that we give you on engaging in those discussion forums on thinking" : (00:13:32.113)
**Westman, Claire** : "about the work." : (00:13:37.953)
**Westman, Claire** : "So philosophy can be challenging." : (00:13:39.568)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I won't sugarcoat that it can be a challenging subject." : (00:13:44.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a different way of reading, a different way of thinking." : (00:13:47.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "So a different way of writing a time so it can be complex," : (00:13:52.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I don't want you to go into this being scared of the module and thinking" : (00:13:55.898)
**Westman, Claire** : "it's something that's so out there and something that you've never engaged in." : (00:14:00.362)
**Westman, Claire** : "Like I said, it's something you do every." : (00:14:04.941)
**Westman, Claire** : "Day you just don't know that you do." : (00:14:07.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously when you're doing philosophy at university," : (00:14:09.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "it is more formal and you need to rely on." : (00:14:14.183)
**Westman, Claire** : "The text that you read, I'm doing research and developing your" : (00:14:18.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "arguments based on referenced and reasoned evidence." : (00:14:22.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "But it is something that you can do and we see that every year people do," : (00:14:28.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "you know, we come up with good arguments that" : (00:14:32.945)
**Westman, Claire** : "understand the theory." : (00:14:35.497)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I don't want you to go into the module feeling overwhelmed," : (00:14:36.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "which can happen with philosophy and obviously we are here to help you through" : (00:14:40.907)
**Westman, Claire** : "the semester, so please don't ever feel worried about" : (00:14:46.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "reaching out or concerned about posting on the forums that maybe people will you" : (00:14:49.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "know." : (00:14:55.136)
**Westman, Claire** : "Think it's a silly question." : (00:14:55.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "I can assure you any questions that you have somebody else in the module," : (00:14:57.748)
**Westman, Claire** : "somebody else is also doing. The module has and they will be very glad" : (00:15:01.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "that you've asked the question so that they can also find out." : (00:15:06.002)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please don't ever be afraid to reach out or to ask US questions." : (00:15:09.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is, the point is, we are here to help you," : (00:15:13.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "to get through this module and to hopefully enjoy the module." : (00:15:16.965)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's the main goal and to help you develop an interest or philosophy and to" : (00:15:21.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "want to continue on in philosophy." : (00:15:27.531)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please always reach out if you need us." : (00:15:30.348)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the prescribed books and reading there is no prescribed book for this module as" : (00:15:35.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "books." : (00:15:40.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry as you will have seen, if you've done the if you've looked" : (00:15:41.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "through the tutorial letter already." : (00:15:44.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "The main source for this module is the study guide," : (00:15:47.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "and if you haven't already downloaded or looked at the study guide," : (00:15:51.883)
**Westman, Claire** : "it's under the official study material link on the PLS 150125 S One site," : (00:15:57.121)
**Westman, Claire** : "so please go get that as soon as Poss." : (00:16:02.821)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you haven't already looked at it because you do need to read through that," : (00:16:05.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "at least the some of the units in order to answer the questions for assessment" : (00:16:11.045)
**Westman, Claire** : "one." : (00:16:16.207)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for your assessments and to prepare for the exam," : (00:16:18.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "you will use the study guide as your main source." : (00:16:21.208)
**Westman, Claire** : "But because you are now at university, we also expect you to do some of your own" : (00:16:24.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "research." : (00:16:30.282)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please." : (00:16:30.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please make sure you focus focus on the study guide," : (00:16:33.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "but do your own research if possible as well," : (00:16:36.698)
**Westman, Claire** : "because that is something that you need to start developing." : (00:16:39.424)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those skills you need to start thinking about what other sources say you need to" : (00:16:43.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "start bringing research into your work." : (00:16:47.837)
**Westman, Claire** : "So other than those, the other resources that you will use are" : (00:16:51.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "the tutorial letter 101." : (00:16:56.375)
**Westman, Claire** : "That obviously if you have looked at it already contains important administrative" : (00:16:58.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "information about the module." : (00:17:03.077)
**Westman, Claire** : "It gives you an overview of the module, so it's very important to go through that" : (00:17:05.028)
**Westman, Claire** : "to just have an understanding of the module." : (00:17:09.858)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you will also find on the site tutorial letter 301 and this is also a" : (00:17:12.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "very important resource for when you're doing your assessments." : (00:17:17.505)
**Westman, Claire** : "This tutorial letter gives you guidelines for writing a philosophical essay and" : (00:17:23.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "very importantly for referencing." : (00:17:28.392)
**Westman, Claire** : "So remember that referencing is absolutely vital." : (00:17:31.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "Any assessment you submit in philosophy and in most other modules," : (00:17:37.028)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I want to speak for others." : (00:17:42.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "But any assessment you submit in philosophy has to include referenced" : (00:17:44.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "evidence." : (00:17:50.334)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you need to have an idea of how to reference so that tutorial letter gives" : (00:17:51.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "you gives explanations of how to reference." : (00:17:57.768)
**Westman, Claire** : "In your work OK." : (00:18:02.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "So very, very, very, very important." : (00:18:03.568)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you also will get tutorial letters 2:01 and 2:02." : (00:18:07.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those are not on the site yet, because those are the follow up tutorial" : (00:18:11.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "letters for the assessments." : (00:18:15.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "So those act in a way as a kind of memo." : (00:18:17.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "Giving you guidelines for what should have been included in the assessments," : (00:18:22.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "how you could have approached the assessments," : (00:18:27.185)
**Westman, Claire** : "the kind of thing that we were looking for when we were marking your assessments," : (00:18:30.132)
**Westman, Claire** : "they won't give you exact answers because in philosophy they are an issue doing" : (00:18:35.272)
**Westman, Claire** : "critical, Phil." : (00:18:40.288)
**Westman, Claire** : "A critical reasoning." : (00:18:41.388)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are very specific answers, but in this module." : (00:18:42.348)
**Westman, Claire** : "They aren't right or wrong answers. The important point is that you" : (00:18:46.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "understand the theory that you are able to explain the theory comprehensively and." : (00:18:51.293)
**Westman, Claire** : "In a way that explain the theory properly and that you are able to develop an" : (00:19:01.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "argument." : (00:19:07.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if we ask you, for example, who do you agree with more Plato or" : (00:19:07.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "Aristotle?" : (00:19:13.472)
**Westman, Claire** : "Neither of those. If you said Plato, or if you said Aristotle." : (00:19:15.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "Neither of those answers are right or wrong." : (00:19:18.998)
**Westman, Claire** : "What we want to see is why you say that." : (00:19:21.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "How you support that answer?" : (00:19:24.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "How you develop your argument, how you make it clear why you are saying" : (00:19:26.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "that you, for example, agree with Plato's theory off the forms" : (00:19:31.556)
**Westman, Claire** : "rather than with Aristotle, OK." : (00:19:35.894)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will never get one straightforward answer to the questions that are in your" : (00:19:38.028)
**Westman, Claire** : "assessments in those follow up tutorial letters." : (00:19:43.695)
**Westman, Claire** : "There will be guidelines of how you could have approached the question." : (00:19:47.040)
**Westman, Claire** : "The primary things that we were looking for." : (00:19:51.956)
**Westman, Claire** : "And how you could have drawn on that information and then closer to the exam," : (00:19:56.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "we will load some past exam papers." : (00:20:02.065)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, these are just to help you and see what" : (00:20:05.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "kinds of questions might be asked in the exams. The way questions might be asked." : (00:20:09.748)
**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously that's not going to be the exact same questions in your exam," : (00:20:18.158)
**Westman, Claire** : "but just to give you an idea of what." : (00:20:22.042)
**Westman, Claire** : "A question what the questions are like in a philosophy exam," : (00:20:24.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "and once you see that then you can start to also think about how you will prepare" : (00:20:27.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "for the exam." : (00:20:32.105)
**Westman, Claire** : "So those will be loaded." : (00:20:32.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "Not right now." : (00:20:36.668)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because for now, we need you to focus on your assessments." : (00:20:37.348)
**Westman, Claire** : "So a little bit later in the semester, we will load those so that you can start" : (00:20:39.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "working through those." : (00:20:43.587)
**Westman, Claire** : "So then for this module, there are three assessments." : (00:20:47.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "There are two assignments and one exam, so you might have already seen this" : (00:20:51.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "information or do some of it in the tutorial letter and on the site," : (00:20:56.928)
**Westman, Claire** : "and these are the kinds of assessments when they do and the semester wait." : (00:21:01.921)
**Westman, Claire** : "So assessment one, you know a short answer questions." : (00:21:07.748)
**Westman, Claire** : "The due date is the 20th of March and it is out of 100." : (00:21:11.283)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what the semester wait means is that this assignment assessment 1 counts 20%" : (00:21:15.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "of your overall semester mark." : (00:21:23.256)
**Westman, Claire** : "So assessment one and assessment 2 together count 40% of your total semester" : (00:21:26.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "mark and your exam count 60%." : (00:21:34.401)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's not something you need to worry about too much." : (00:21:38.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's just showing you that the exam has a slightly greater waiting than the other" : (00:21:42.877)
**Westman, Claire** : "assessments." : (00:21:48.417)
**Westman, Claire** : "But it's it's not something you really need to be stressed about." : (00:21:49.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just do your assessments as best as you can." : (00:21:52.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "Make sure that you submit assessment one and assessment 2." : (00:21:56.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "Both are mandatory for this module." : (00:22:00.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "So and if you submit only one of them, then you are likely not to do very well" : (00:22:04.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "overall in the semester. It will affect your overall grade." : (00:22:11.867)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it is mandatory that you do assessment one and two assessment 2 which is due on" : (00:22:17.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "the 25th of April is an essay question." : (00:22:24.153)
**Westman, Claire** : "And again, it's out of 100 and waiting of 20% and" : (00:22:28.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "then the exam will consist of short answers and an essay." : (00:22:32.194)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it will combine the kinds of questions you've been asked in assessment one and" : (00:22:36.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "assessment two and we can't give you the date for that yet because the exam" : (00:22:41.477)
**Westman, Claire** : "timetable is not out yet, but it is in May or June, yeah." : (00:22:46.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I've already received some questions about assessment one and I don't want to" : (00:22:50.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "go into too much detail about it now, but just to address the ones that I've" : (00:22:54.571)
**Westman, Claire** : "received a few questions about." : (00:22:58.661)
**Westman, Claire** : "One question was do you need introductions and conclusions?" : (00:23:01.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "It states very clearly in the assessment." : (00:23:04.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "Instructions do not include introductions or conclusions for assessment." : (00:23:07.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "One they are short answer questions." : (00:23:13.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "Each question has a word limit of 300 words, which might seem like a lot," : (00:23:16.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "but it is not. So if you including in an introduction" : (00:23:21.321)
**Westman, Claire** : "and a conclusion in those 300 words, you're not really going to have enough" : (00:23:25.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "space to get to the most important inform." : (00:23:30.321)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for assessment one, you just have to include." : (00:23:34.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "The what we would call the body of the answer, OK." : (00:23:40.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "So just include the most important information that's needed to answer the" : (00:23:42.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "question that's needed to help you develop your discussion or your argument," : (00:23:47.570)
**Westman, Claire** : "depending on what the question is. You do not need to include introductions" : (00:23:52.387)
**Westman, Claire** : "or conclusions for assessment one." : (00:23:57.141)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then I've had quite a few people emailing me about if they need a cover page." : (00:24:00.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is not compulsory to include a cover page." : (00:24:06.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's no mark for it, but it is good to get into the habit of" : (00:24:08.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "doing cover pages, so you are welcome to include a cover" : (00:24:13.291)
**Westman, Claire** : "page, but you won't be penalized if you don't." : (00:24:17.471)
**Westman, Claire** : "The same with the contents page. If you want to include a contents page," : (00:24:22.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're welcome to, but you will not lose marks if you don't" : (00:24:26.617)
**Westman, Claire** : "include one." : (00:24:30.026)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then people have asked me about the the font." : (00:24:32.278)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you can use one of the more academic fronts. One of the more formal fonts." : (00:24:35.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Calibri, aerial or times new Roman and I would" : (00:24:40.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "suggest size 11 or 12." : (00:24:46.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "Hard and fast rules about it, but size 10 can be difficult for us to" : (00:24:51.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "read." : (00:24:56.016)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you have challenges with your eyesight and you need to type in bigger font," : (00:24:57.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "then please do so absolutely, but otherwise stick to around size 11 or" : (00:25:03.637)
**Westman, Claire** : "12 and then again with line spacing." : (00:25:08.814)
**Westman, Claire** : "There are no specific rules about it, but it is easier for us to read when" : (00:25:11.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "we're marking. If your line spacing is 1 1/2 or two." : (00:25:16.706)
**Westman, Claire** : "Even so, those are just some of the general" : (00:25:20.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "guidelines for the more technical aspects of the assignment." : (00:25:23.785)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very, very important for the assignment." : (00:25:29.188)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember to include your in text referencing and a bibliography." : (00:25:31.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so that is something that you must" : (00:25:37.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "include, but I'm not going to focus on the content" : (00:25:39.974)
**Westman, Claire** : "of the assessment right now." : (00:25:43.082)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you have questions about that, please do send them to me or post them on" : (00:25:46.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "the discussion forums and we can address them there as well." : (00:25:50.832)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then very importantly is that there are others resources that you can use in" : (00:25:56.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "order to help you with your assessments and in order to help you with your" : (00:26:00.832)
**Westman, Claire** : "studies, you have obviously access to the library," : (00:26:05.197)
**Westman, Claire** : "which is essential for your research and your studying a lot of." : (00:26:08.165)
**Westman, Claire** : "The information can be accessed online, so that's important." : (00:26:11.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "There are also librarians who can assist you," : (00:26:17.188)
**Westman, Claire** : "so please go look at the library web page and just play around on it to see what" : (00:26:20.323)
**Westman, Claire** : "information is on there, what resources are available to you." : (00:26:25.843)
**Westman, Claire** : "The contact numbers or e-mail addresses for people who work in the library that" : (00:26:31.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "can also assist you if you need any assistance and then very very," : (00:26:36.923)
**Westman, Claire** : "very beneficial are the online databases." : (00:26:41.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "These are very convenient and reliable way to access academic articles." : (00:26:45.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm sure a lot of you don't know how to use the online databases at this stage." : (00:26:51.008)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm going to make a video showing you the exact steps of how to access the online" : (00:26:57.018)
**Westman, Claire** : "databases, which I will load." : (00:27:03.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "Onto the site." : (00:27:05.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because when you are doing your assessments," : (00:27:07.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "you need to make sure that you are using reliable academic sources and the online" : (00:27:10.535)
**Westman, Claire** : "databases are probably the easiest way for you to go about finding good academic" : (00:27:16.852)
**Westman, Claire** : "sources." : (00:27:23.092)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's it contains thousands of journals." : (00:27:25.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "And articles and so when you go onto the databases once you know how to use them," : (00:27:30.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "it's a really, really great way to find those articles" : (00:27:36.242)
**Westman, Claire** : "that you can use as research that you can use for your assessments." : (00:27:40.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I will make a video for that. So please go watch that once I've loaded" : (00:27:45.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "it, I'll send out an announcement because" : (00:27:50.105)
**Westman, Claire** : "that will help you through the whole of your university career." : (00:27:52.668)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will need to know how to use slides. So if you don't already know." : (00:27:56.575)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some of you might." : (00:28:01.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then please go watch the video. Once I've done that." : (00:28:02.398)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then, of course, there are also many other student" : (00:28:06.328)
**Westman, Claire** : "resources which I'm sure you've been told about and alluded to by the university." : (00:28:09.636)
**Westman, Claire** : "So always just go look on the unisa page to see on Unisa website to see what other" : (00:28:15.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "resources are available for you, OK." : (00:28:21.227)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then so some of the expectations that we have for you as students in this" : (00:28:25.288)
**Westman, Claire** : "module very, very, very important is that you check the site" : (00:28:31.088)
**Westman, Claire** : "regularly." : (00:28:35.625)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, it's just having especially the" : (00:28:38.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "announcements, important information is shared in those" : (00:28:41.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "announcements. So please check on their regularly to see" : (00:28:45.612)
**Westman, Claire** : "if there's any new information. All the resources that you need on that," : (00:28:49.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "the PLS 150125 is one site, so make sure that." : (00:28:55.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "You are very familiar with it." : (00:28:58.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know how to use it." : (00:29:00.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can access those resources if you have any issues with accessing the site." : (00:29:01.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please let us know as soon as possible so that we can assist you with that or put" : (00:29:06.895)
**Westman, Claire** : "you on to the people who can assist with that." : (00:29:11.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "You need to read all of your study materials very carefully." : (00:29:16.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "That includes a tutorial 101, the study guide." : (00:29:20.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "Tutorial 301 and then of course, once the tutorial 200 litres are out," : (00:29:25.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can also look through those." : (00:29:30.472)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very, very, very important is that you submit your" : (00:29:34.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "assessments before the due date." : (00:29:36.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or at least on the due date on the day that they're due." : (00:29:39.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do not wait until the last minute, though. Sometimes what happens is because" : (00:29:44.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "everybody's trying to submit assignments at the same time at 1059 minutes." : (00:29:49.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "During 11 the system crashes or you have technical challenges and then you don't" : (00:29:54.078)
**Westman, Claire** : "submit your assignment." : (00:29:59.616)
**Westman, Claire** : "Unless you have a very, very valid reason, for example universal bit," : (00:30:02.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "a death in the family, or an illness that you have a doctor's" : (00:30:07.961)
**Westman, Claire** : "note for." : (00:30:12.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that would have severely impacted on you submitting." : (00:30:15.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "We do not accept assignments by e-mail, OK." : (00:30:20.751)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you must make sure that you submit in time so that you can." : (00:30:24.583)
**Westman, Claire** : "Contact us if there are any challenges that you face or that you can." : (00:30:32.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "Submit, try again and submit again. If the system is down or anything like" : (00:30:38.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "that. OK, we know that there can be technical" : (00:30:42.288)
**Westman, Claire** : "challenges." : (00:30:44.895)
**Westman, Claire** : "We know in this country issues with network and load shedding," : (00:30:45.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "but your assignments are given to you while in advance," : (00:30:50.436)
**Westman, Claire** : "so they shouldn't really be any technical excuses." : (00:30:54.807)
**Westman, Claire** : "So generally we see those when people are trying to submit their watch, says 1058." : (00:30:59.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "But on the system it's 11/01 and the submission has closed OK." : (00:31:04.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please do not wait until the very last minute." : (00:31:09.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "So my suggestion is always try and submit." : (00:31:14.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "At least a day or two in advance, in case there are any challenges." : (00:31:17.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you can't do that, try at least submit a few hours before" : (00:31:21.954)
**Westman, Claire** : "the deadline. OK, so for for both your assessments," : (00:31:26.077)
**Westman, Claire** : "the deadline is 11 at night, but try and submit in advance of that." : (00:31:29.592)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. And if you have challenges, please let us know as it says in the last" : (00:31:35.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "point, as soon as you possibly can, because if you come to us three weeks" : (00:31:40.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "later and say I couldn't submit assessment one because of whatever reason" : (00:31:45.461)
**Westman, Claire** : "it might be too late for us." : (00:31:50.312)
**Westman, Claire** : "To do anything about it, remember there are cut off dates as well" : (00:31:52.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "for us to submit marks to the to the university." : (00:31:56.372)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are." : (00:32:01.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are processes that we have to follow behind the scenes that sometimes mean" : (00:32:02.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "that there's no way that we can help you." : (00:32:06.604)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you have any kinds of challenges, let us know straight away." : (00:32:08.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "As soon as you are possible so that we can see how best we can help you. OK," : (00:32:13.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "engage in the online activities and discussions which a lot of you have" : (00:32:18.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "already been doing, which is amazing." : (00:32:23.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "The some of you have been doing the introductions and I always love the" : (00:32:25.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "introductions because it's very difficult to get to know you when we are in this" : (00:32:30.476)
**Westman, Claire** : "online environment." : (00:32:35.524)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the introductions are one way that I can get to know you that the other people" : (00:32:36.708)
**Westman, Claire** : "you are studying with can get to know a little bit about you." : (00:32:41.104)
**Westman, Claire** : "So thank you to everyone who's been doing the introductions." : (00:32:44.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've been reading through them as they've been coming up," : (00:32:47.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "obviously won't respond to all of them, but I'm very grateful for those of you" : (00:32:50.636)
**Westman, Claire** : "who have been doing them as well As for those of you who have been doing the" : (00:32:54.733)
**Westman, Claire** : "reflections." : (00:32:58.726)
**Westman, Claire** : "But what's very important about the activities in this discussions is they" : (00:33:00.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "can help you to improve your understanding there." : (00:33:05.808)
**Westman, Claire** : "A place where you can raise any questions or concerns that you have and it also" : (00:33:09.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "helps us as the PLS 1501 team to see what areas." : (00:33:14.283)
**Westman, Claire** : "We might need to assist with what areas need more attention," : (00:33:17.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "what parts of the module the content of the module." : (00:33:21.964)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are you struggling with that?" : (00:33:25.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "Need more attention?" : (00:33:26.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we help you better in the module?" : (00:33:28.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "So those discussions are a way for us to also help you and then prepare for and" : (00:33:32.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "attend." : (00:33:38.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, if you're not able to attend, catch up on the discussion classes or the" : (00:33:40.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "recorded lessons. And when we have these discussion classes." : (00:33:45.221)
**Westman, Claire** : "So from next week on, we'll be having them regularly and we'll" : (00:33:48.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "be looking at the content of the module." : (00:33:53.263)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please prepare in advance by reading through the relevant section." : (00:33:56.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "That or relevant material that we will be focusing on in the discussion session." : (00:34:00.668)
**Westman, Claire** : "In those discussion classes, I will not be repeating everything that's" : (00:34:05.998)
**Westman, Claire** : "in the study guide, right?" : (00:34:10.441)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because the study guide is there for you to read it," : (00:34:12.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I'm not going to just repeat what's in there. That would be boring for you." : (00:34:14.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "It would not be super helpful." : (00:34:18.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "There will be an overview of the unit." : (00:34:21.598)
**Westman, Claire** : "There will be an overview of the content, but much more importantly," : (00:34:23.158)
**Westman, Claire** : "there a chance for you to ask questions about the content to gain clarification" : (00:34:28.005)
**Westman, Claire** : "on anything that is unclear to you. Their chance for us to engage with each" : (00:34:33.625)
**Westman, Claire** : "other for you to develop a deeper understanding stand." : (00:34:38.964)
**Westman, Claire** : "Off the content. So if you attend the discussion class and" : (00:34:42.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "you haven't read anything and you have no idea what we're talking about," : (00:34:46.503)
**Westman, Claire** : "they will not be as beneficial for you as if you prepare in advance." : (00:34:51.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because if you already have some kind of idea of what we're talking about," : (00:34:55.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "you'll be able to focus more during the discussion session." : (00:34:59.313)
**Westman, Claire** : "You'll be able to think about what you've been reading." : (00:35:02.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will have the questions that you're concerned about," : (00:35:06.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "all the areas that need clarification for you," : (00:35:09.386)
**Westman, Claire** : "so please do prepare in advance for those sessions." : (00:35:12.121)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then finally." : (00:35:16.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are there any expectations that you have for the module or that you have for" : (00:35:19.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "either me or for me and Mr. Popapi, as the PLS 1501 team?" : (00:35:25.250)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are there any things that in particular that you are hoping to gain from this or" : (00:35:29.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "that you hope you know we can help you with or that you expect from us while" : (00:35:34.701)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're going through the module or do you have any other questions or concerns as" : (00:35:39.324)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're getting?" : (00:35:44.248)
**Westman, Claire** : "Started with the module." : (00:35:45.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you do, you can put up your hand and ask them." : (00:35:46.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can pop them in the chat. Anything that you are at this stage" : (00:35:48.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "concerned about any questions you have at this stage." : (00:35:54.063)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, while you're thinking and writing in the" : (00:36:01.778)
**Westman, Claire** : "chat." : (00:36:03.974)
**Westman, Claire** : "I will just say." : (00:36:05.718)
**Westman, Claire** : "With regards to the assessments, we often get emails from students saying" : (00:36:08.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "I haven't got my marks. My friend has got these or when are we" : (00:36:13.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "getting our marks?" : (00:36:18.207)
**Westman, Claire** : "So just so that you have an idea." : (00:36:19.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "The average turn around time or the time that we are given is between 2 weeks and" : (00:36:23.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "three weeks." : (00:36:29.226)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we aim very much to have your marks back to you within that time," : (00:36:30.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "two to three weeks, but sometimes remember, as I said," : (00:36:35.702)
**Westman, Claire** : "there's four of us who do marking." : (00:36:39.587)
**Westman, Claire** : "So one of your friends might have their marks done." : (00:36:42.188)
**Westman, Claire** : "Before it might get their assignment back before you," : (00:36:48.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "but if it goes past three weeks and you don't have your mark or everybody else" : (00:36:51.408)
**Westman, Claire** : "has theirs and you haven't seen yours, or there's an issue." : (00:36:56.222)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then please contact us, K." : (00:37:00.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:37:05.038)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'm seeing a lot of questions here, so let me go through them." : (00:37:05.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "Help understanding Palmer needles." : (00:37:11.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please, we will focus on that in next week's" : (00:37:12.558)
**Westman, Claire** : "session if that is OK, Dylan." : (00:37:15.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "We'll have class once a week." : (00:37:19.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "It won't always be a teams meeting." : (00:37:21.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some weeks I will just load." : (00:37:24.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "Pre recorded lessons or reading material for you." : (00:37:28.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it won't always be an in person class, but in general it will be once a week and" : (00:37:33.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "it will be at this time every Wednesday." : (00:37:38.321)
**Westman, Claire** : "This seems to be a fairly good time since there are about 85 of you here," : (00:37:42.278)
**Westman, Claire** : "which is a very high turn out, so that's fantastic." : (00:37:46.554)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can you submit your assignment OK?" : (00:37:51.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'll very quickly once I've gone through the questions," : (00:37:54.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "share my screen to show you where you find the assignment and how you submit it." : (00:37:57.668)
**Westman, Claire** : "Tristan asks." : (00:38:05.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are there any specific YouTube channels or videos or other material for extra" : (00:38:06.388)
**Westman, Claire** : "info about philosophy and in general and just a fun listen or watch off the top of" : (00:38:11.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "my head right now?" : (00:38:16.462)
**Westman, Claire** : "I can't think of specific ones, but I will put a little list on." : (00:38:19.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "The site." : (00:38:27.078)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm currently listening to. It's called a life well lived." : (00:38:29.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a podcast." : (00:38:34.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "I found it on Spotify and it is hosted by Peter Singer who is a very renowned" : (00:38:35.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosopher." : (00:38:43.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "He's particularly works in animal ethics and utilitarianism," : (00:38:46.078)
**Westman, Claire** : "so not exactly what you're doing in this module," : (00:38:50.024)
**Westman, Claire** : "but it is a very interesting podcast he hosted with another with a Polish" : (00:38:53.194)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosopher." : (00:38:57.982)
**Westman, Claire** : "She does work around hedonism and they interviewing all kinds of people from" : (00:38:58.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "various sort of industries and walks of life." : (00:39:06.383)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the one I'm listening to at the moment is with a historian." : (00:39:10.938)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very interesting." : (00:39:14.898)
**Westman, Claire** : "That also have people on like Jane Goodall, the person who founded Peter," : (00:39:15.618)
**Westman, Claire** : "the Peter Organization." : (00:39:20.348)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that one's called a laugh." : (00:39:22.058)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well lived." : (00:39:24.098)
**Westman, Claire** : "It talks a lot about." : (00:39:24.818)
**Westman, Claire** : "What makes a good laugh?" : (00:39:27.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "Which are some of the things that you'll be sort of considering in this module?" : (00:39:29.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "What does it mean to live a good life?" : (00:39:33.188)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we live with others?" : (00:39:34.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we improve?" : (00:39:36.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of the world around us." : (00:39:37.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's a great one." : (00:39:39.068)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it's not too complex." : (00:39:41.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that would be a good one to listen to, but otherwise I'll have a look for some" : (00:39:42.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "others for you as well." : (00:39:47.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "Turn it in." : (00:39:50.478)
**Westman, Claire** : "We will look closer at the time, but Turnitin is built into the my Unisa" : (00:39:51.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "platform." : (00:39:56.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you submit your assignment on the in the normal assessment two submission" : (00:39:57.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "area, it will automatically be sent to turn it" : (00:40:02.978)
**Westman, Claire** : "in OK and you will get three opportunities." : (00:40:06.268)
**Westman, Claire** : "To submit it." : (00:40:10.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you submit the first time and realize, Oh no, we oh," : (00:40:11.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "I didn't realize that I'd used AI to write this whole assignment." : (00:40:15.815)
**Westman, Claire** : "And now my whole thing's plagiarized, which would be a very odd thing," : (00:40:20.378)
**Westman, Claire** : "because you would know that you'd used AI." : (00:40:24.651)
**Westman, Claire** : "But if for some reason it happens that you get a very high turnitin result," : (00:40:27.178)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can resubmit." : (00:40:33.814)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I don't want to go too much into turnitin in now." : (00:40:36.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I know this is a question that I get all the time." : (00:40:39.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is an acceptable percentage on turnitin?" : (00:40:43.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's very difficult to say." : (00:40:47.708)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because we look at the more of the detail of the report rather than the percentage." : (00:40:51.178)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you know you have paraphrased so you've written in your own words," : (00:40:57.418)
**Westman, Claire** : "you've included your referencing." : (00:41:01.688)
**Westman, Claire** : "You haven't used AI to do your answer, even if it's a higher percentage," : (00:41:03.818)
**Westman, Claire** : "you don't need to panic. OK, as long as you know you've done what you" : (00:41:08.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "need to." : (00:41:12.947)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's all you have to worry about." : (00:41:13.698)
**Westman, Claire** : "The unique codes they are there in the instructions," : (00:41:16.708)
**Westman, Claire** : "but you don't actually need them." : (00:41:19.223)
**Westman, Claire** : "That was, we say that you need to know the unique" : (00:41:20.788)
**Westman, Claire** : "code, but that was more for when you did paper" : (00:41:24.214)
**Westman, Claire** : "based submissions." : (00:41:27.435)
**Westman, Claire** : "Now obviously the submissions just come directly to us." : (00:41:28.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you don't need to worry too much, but they are on the instructions." : (00:41:31.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'll show you when we go there." : (00:41:35.668)
**Westman, Claire** : "I have not started a WhatsApp group for the module because there are concerns" : (00:41:38.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "around the protection of your information." : (00:41:43.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "You are very welcome to start a WhatsApp group for the module and you're welcome" : (00:41:46.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "to add me to that group." : (00:41:52.248)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'll put my number here if you want to add me to the WhatsApp group," : (00:41:53.818)
**Westman, Claire** : "but there are some concerns around Poppy. If we start the group and add you so." : (00:42:00.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or you join." : (00:42:08.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I suggest that one of your students start the WhatsApp group and we can take" : (00:42:09.348)
**Westman, Claire** : "it from there." : (00:42:15.272)
**Westman, Claire** : "I will put a WhatsApp discussion forum and you can discuss there about joining" : (00:42:16.308)
**Westman, Claire** : "the WhatsApp group." : (00:42:23.466)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. No, on the assignment we have to write each" : (00:42:29.098)
**Westman, Claire** : "question as essay." : (00:42:31.542)
**Westman, Claire** : "No, I've discussed that." : (00:42:32.458)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't have to write each. You answer each question you say 1." : (00:42:33.898)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you've got question one, you answer it." : (00:42:39.988)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't have to have an introduction and conclusion." : (00:42:41.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is not a proper essay." : (00:42:44.948)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is short answer questions so you don't include an introduction." : (00:42:46.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "Don't include a conclusion." : (00:42:50.988)

**Westman, Claire** : "those are all things we're going to do in the module." : (00:43:11.987)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'm not going to get into that now." : (00:43:14.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a great question." : (00:43:16.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you, Elton." : (00:43:17.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "But that is sort of the core of the module." : (00:43:19.158)

**Westman, Claire** : "It's perfect." : (00:43:48.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's exactly what you need and all you can see is the abstract." : (00:43:49.588)

**Westman, Claire** : "It'll take you to to the journal site and the journal will want you to pay." : (00:44:02.207)
**Westman, Claire** : "For the article that's just that's very normal journal practice," : (00:44:06.818)

**Westman, Claire** : "those articles and that is why we have the online databases." : (00:44:16.455)

**Westman, Claire** : "you can search for that source on the online databases or that article on the" : (00:44:32.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "online databases." : (00:44:36.890)
**Westman, Claire** : "If the full text is not available on Google Scholar very often," : (00:44:39.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "the full text is available on Google Scholar, but not always. OK," : (00:44:42.816)
**Westman, Claire** : "but it's of good source, and that's a very good question." : (00:44:46.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you." : (00:44:49.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "Another place that you can sometimes find good articles is on a place called" : (00:44:51.708)

**Westman, Claire** : "So sometimes I've put the thing in the name in the comments." : (00:45:00.428)

**Westman, Claire** : "ResearchGate their own articles that they've written." : (00:45:11.508)
**Westman, Claire** : "And sometimes." : (00:45:15.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "They you can e-mail them even and ask them to send you the article." : (00:45:18.668)

**Westman, Claire** : "answer." : (00:46:34.046)
**Westman, Claire** : "So where you use the information you include the reference." : (00:46:35.378)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if I write a sentence saying Plato says that all we see on Earth are" : (00:46:39.738)
**Westman, Claire** : "imitations of the form, I would put my reference there." : (00:46:45.723)

**Westman, Claire** : "or that you don't really understand it too well, OK." : (01:01:10.256)

**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously, if you're in putting whole quotes whole" : (01:01:44.568)
**Westman, Claire** : "paragraphs in it will lead to you not getting as many marks," : (01:01:48.839)
