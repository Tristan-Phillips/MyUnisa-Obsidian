**Westman, Claire** : "Again, you might have to try and leave and come" : (00:00:04.690)
**Westman, Claire** : "back." : (00:00:06.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "Unfortunately." : (00:00:08.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can everybody else see it?" : (00:00:13.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just give me a thumbs up because I see a lot of people can, but can you OK." : (00:00:15.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, that was a lot of thumbs up in one go, OK?" : (00:00:20.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, fantastic. Thank you." : (00:00:24.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "Like I've never seen so many thumbs up in one go in a meeting that was quite" : (00:00:27.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "exciting." : (00:00:32.465)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, if you're having trouble seeing it, maybe try." : (00:00:33.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "Leaving it coming back or yeah." : (00:00:38.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "Otherwise, maybe just stay in the meeting for now." : (00:00:42.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you want to and then." : (00:00:46.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, you can see it through your phone and not" : (00:00:51.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "your PC, OK?" : (00:00:53.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it might be something to do with your settings or your network or something" : (00:00:53.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "along those lines." : (00:00:58.356)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:01:00.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "So welcome everybody." : (00:01:01.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's so nice to again see so many people joining today." : (00:01:02.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very exciting and I hope you have all been having a good week so far and that" : (00:01:06.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "the Semester is going OK so far." : (00:01:12.332)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know a lot of people are panicking about the assessment and just about." : (00:01:14.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "Philosophy in general, and like I said in the last meeting," : (00:01:21.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy is it's different." : (00:01:26.315)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a different kind of text." : (00:01:28.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a different way of reading and thinking than you're probably used to," : (00:01:31.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "so please don't panic too much." : (00:01:35.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will hopefully sort of get used to it as you're going through as you're reading" : (00:01:38.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "more." : (00:01:43.717)
**Westman, Claire** : "And also just use different resources because sometimes some people learn" : (00:01:46.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "better using different kinds of resources." : (00:01:50.385)
**Westman, Claire** : "If, for example, you are struggling with understanding" : (00:01:53.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "what's in the study guide, there are so many very good videos on" : (00:01:58.014)
**Westman, Claire** : "YouTube that breakdown these complex concepts into quite simple explanations." : (00:02:03.608)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously you know, those are resources that are available to" : (00:02:10.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "you." : (00:02:14.973)
**Westman, Claire** : "So go and do your own research." : (00:02:15.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "Go look and see what you can find." : (00:02:17.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "That will help you look for different kinds of texts." : (00:02:19.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "Look for different kinds of blogs." : (00:02:23.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anything that's going to help you understand better." : (00:02:26.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just remember that when it comes to including evidence in your assignments," : (00:02:30.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "it must be credible." : (00:02:37.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "Academic evidence." : (00:02:38.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "So while I suggest you go and watch videos and you can read blogs you can" : (00:02:41.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "read." : (00:02:47.691)
**Westman, Claire** : "Whatever you can find that helps you understand when you are using the" : (00:02:49.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "information in your assignment, you must make sure that it is from" : (00:02:55.076)
**Westman, Claire** : "credible academic sources. So use those online databases." : (00:02:59.876)
**Westman, Claire** : "I put the video." : (00:03:04.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "Online for you if you haven't watched it yet." : (00:03:05.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please some people. OK, let me just mute all in case." : (00:03:10.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:03:14.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please make sure that you go and watch that video if you don't know how to use" : (00:03:16.600)
**Westman, Claire** : "the online databases yet." : (00:03:20.733)
**Westman, Claire** : "Hopefully those of you who have watched it already found it helpful." : (00:03:22.040)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know it was about half an hour, but I wanted to make sure that you fully" : (00:03:26.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "understood how to use it and could play around on it, not just for this module." : (00:03:30.777)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for all your modules, so please use resources available to you" : (00:03:35.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "and don't just panic because you don't understand what's in the study guide." : (00:03:39.597)
**Westman, Claire** : "There are lots of resources that you can use that try that will hopefully help you" : (00:03:44.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "to understand a bit better. So in today's session I'm just going to" : (00:03:50.097)
**Westman, Claire** : "be going over some of the content that might help you to answer questions one" : (00:03:55.002)
**Westman, Claire** : "and question 2 for assessment one." : (00:04:00.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "Next week." : (00:04:03.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know it's the day before your assignment is due," : (00:04:05.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "but we're going to look at question 3." : (00:04:08.216)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what I suggest is that by the time we get to next Wednesday," : (00:04:10.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "you have question one and two complete and finished and happy you're happy with" : (00:04:15.296)
**Westman, Claire** : "it to submit and that you've started working on Question 3." : (00:04:21.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "So make sure you've done the reading for Question 3." : (00:04:25.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "Make sure you've started coming up with your answers so that when we do the" : (00:04:28.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "session." : (00:04:33.093)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can just go back and check if there's any." : (00:04:34.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thing you need to add or anything you need to change." : (00:04:36.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "And you think extra that's come up while we were doing the session so that you" : (00:04:40.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "don't have to then rush to try and finish it by the next day." : (00:04:46.062)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's my suggestion for you." : (00:04:50.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're not going to approach this semester quite this way," : (00:04:54.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I've seen on the the WhatsApp group and from the emails and on the platform" : (00:04:58.802)
**Westman, Claire** : "that there is quite a lot of stress and I don't want you to stress so much so." : (00:05:04.376)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're going to do that today." : (00:05:11.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we're going to look at question one and then we're going to look at Question" : (00:05:12.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "2." : (00:05:16.445)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you can ask questions." : (00:05:17.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "I do want to keep this within an hour because I know you have a lot going on" : (00:05:19.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "and you need to work on the assignment and everybody's busy and you've got other" : (00:05:24.486)
**Westman, Claire** : "classes." : (00:05:29.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we're going to try and keep it so that we end by 11. Obviously," : (00:05:30.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "if there are any other questions that you have, you're welcome to e-mail them to me." : (00:05:34.316)
**Westman, Claire** : "Put them on the PLS 1501 site." : (00:05:40.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's great to see that a lot of you are what's also great to see is on the" : (00:05:44.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "WhatsApp group that you're all helping each other and giving each other advice" : (00:05:48.993)
**Westman, Claire** : "and suggestions. That is fantastic." : (00:05:53.925)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm so glad to see that." : (00:05:56.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "So thank you to everybody for engaging with each other for helping each other" : (00:05:57.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "and for trying to help everyone else be successful as well in the module." : (00:06:02.431)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because we're focusing." : (00:06:07.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "On the questions that you have for the assessment, I'm not going to go into." : (00:06:10.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "Detail about units one and two." : (00:06:17.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're going to look at what would most likely be the most useful information to" : (00:06:20.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "help you answer the assessments questions." : (00:06:26.567)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm also not going to go over everything that's in your study guide." : (00:06:29.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "The study guide is there for you to read and hopefully after the lesson," : (00:06:35.360)
**Westman, Claire** : "if you go back and read." : (00:06:40.026)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might feel a little bit more comfortable with it as well." : (00:06:42.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'm definitely not going over the study guards information." : (00:06:45.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're going to look at very summarized version of those two sections of the" : (00:06:49.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "study guide that will be important for right now." : (00:06:54.162)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:06:59.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might still have questions about units one and two," : (00:07:01.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "but we will also come back to those after the assessment is submitted and you're" : (00:07:04.991)
**Westman, Claire** : "feeling a bit less panicked." : (00:07:09.665)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK so." : (00:07:12.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "The first question is." : (00:07:15.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "Related to African philosophy." : (00:07:19.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the question asks you is the continued dominance of Western philosophy in an" : (00:07:21.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "African country something ethically desirable and sustainable? In your answer," : (00:07:27.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "you must consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritising Western" : (00:07:34.138)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophical thought." : (00:07:40.507)
**Westman, Claire** : "In this context, so the first thing I want to do is" : (00:07:42.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "breakdown this question so you will see I've highlighted some words here and the" : (00:07:46.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "oops, sorry." : (00:07:52.033)
**Westman, Claire** : "Dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:07:54.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let's see dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:07:58.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:08:00.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "Maybe that's making it worse." : (00:08:01.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "Harder to see." : (00:08:04.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, so that is content that you have to focus" : (00:08:05.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "on." : (00:08:10.885)
**Westman, Claire** : "In an African country, you can look specifically at South Africa" : (00:08:12.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "because that is focused on in your study guide," : (00:08:16.492)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can speak about African countries more generally," : (00:08:19.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I think it would be beneficial for you to focus on South Africa because that" : (00:08:23.178)
**Westman, Claire** : "is what is discussed in detail." : (00:08:28.488)
**Westman, Claire** : "In the study guide, So what we're looking at is how Western" : (00:08:30.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy is still dominant." : (00:08:34.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "In African." : (00:08:37.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "Universities, African institutions." : (00:08:40.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "Higher learning institutions so." : (00:08:42.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the potential benefits of Western philosophy?" : (00:08:46.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the potential drawbacks of making Western philosophy more prominent" : (00:08:49.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "in an African country than it is than is African philosophy OK?" : (00:08:55.725)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's the content. The dominance of Western philosophy." : (00:09:00.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "Your focus is on an African country and some of the things you're going to look" : (00:09:04.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "at are the benefits of prioritizing Western philosophical thought." : (00:09:10.124)
**Westman, Claire** : "And the negatives or the drawbacks?" : (00:09:15.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of prioritizing Western philosophy at philosophical thought," : (00:09:17.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "but what you also need to argue is an ethically desirable." : (00:09:22.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it something that can be argued for ethically?" : (00:09:29.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "Should this should Western philosophy continue to be prioritized over African" : (00:09:34.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy?" : (00:09:40.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the ethical implications of that?" : (00:09:41.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then is it sustainable?" : (00:09:45.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can it continue?" : (00:09:47.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can we continue to prioritize Western philosophy in an African context?" : (00:09:49.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the problems that might make it unsustainable?" : (00:09:56.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the reasons that it might be sustainable?" : (00:10:00.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what this question is asking you is to think about why Western philosophy is" : (00:10:04.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "dominant." : (00:10:11.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why it is a problem?" : (00:10:13.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or maybe not a problem that it is prioritized and should it continue to be" : (00:10:15.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritized or not?" : (00:10:21.836)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:10:25.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "So whenever you have a question, try to break it down and think what what" : (00:10:25.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "is the content of the question." : (00:10:30.555)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is the focus of the question and what is it asking me to do?" : (00:10:32.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "How am I supposed to answer this?" : (00:10:37.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will see that this is not just asking you." : (00:10:39.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "To explain why Western philosophy is prioritized," : (00:10:44.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "it's asking you to go beyond that." : (00:10:49.088)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's asking you to develop an argument." : (00:10:52.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "For where you explain why you think it is desirable or not," : (00:10:57.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "and why you think it is sustainable or not," : (00:11:01.298)
**Westman, Claire** : "so you're going to go beyond just explaining what's in the study guide in" : (00:11:04.214)
**Westman, Claire** : "order to develop this argument that shows us what your opinion is." : (00:11:09.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "But remember, these are not opinion pieces," : (00:11:14.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "so they need to be backed up with your evidence." : (00:11:17.233)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, the study guide is the main source, but you can use other any other academic" : (00:11:20.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "resources that help you to answer the question." : (00:11:27.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's break it down." : (00:11:32.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "The introduction of Western philosophy to South Africa." : (00:11:35.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "Came with sort of the colonization of Africa." : (00:11:39.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "And with the arrival of colonizers in South Africa, so again," : (00:11:44.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm not going to go into this in detail." : (00:11:48.814)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's in your study guide." : (00:11:51.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "And this is not necessarily something you need to explain in detail," : (00:11:55.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "but it might help you to provide a little bit of background into the question or" : (00:12:00.957)
**Westman, Claire** : "into your answer to say why it is not ethically sustainable," : (00:12:06.929)
**Westman, Claire** : "why it is or ethically desirable, why it is a problem." : (00:12:11.426)
**Westman, Claire** : "That Western philosophy is still prioritized." : (00:12:16.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when Western philosophy was brought to South African universities and" : (00:12:19.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "institutions." : (00:12:24.076)
**Westman, Claire** : "There was 2 main traditions that were brought into our universities," : (00:12:27.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "so the first was the Afrikaans Continental tradition." : (00:12:32.952)
**Westman, Claire** : "And in the study guide it explains that this was found in particular universities." : (00:12:38.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "The kinds of people that some of the most influential figures in the tradition," : (00:12:43.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "what sort of the philosophy focused on, but the main point." : (00:12:49.526)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is that philosophical theories that came out of this tradition were often used to" : (00:12:54.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "support and justify apartheid and discrimination," : (00:13:01.901)
**Westman, Claire** : "so they were bringing philosophical theories from Europe to South Africa and" : (00:13:06.456)
**Westman, Claire** : "then using those as justification for apartheid and for discrimination." : (00:13:13.471)
**Westman, Claire** : "Against the indigenous people of South Africa." : (00:13:20.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "The other main tradition was the Anglo-Saxon tradition." : (00:13:24.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, go read through your study guide to see" : (00:13:28.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "which universities it was founded, who the sort of most prominent figures in" : (00:13:31.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "their tradition were, and sort of what the focus of that" : (00:13:36.378)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy was." : (00:13:40.101)
**Westman, Claire** : "But again, it was also used to justify racial and" : (00:13:41.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "cultural discrimination when it sort of first came to the country." : (00:13:44.552)
**Westman, Claire** : "However." : (00:13:49.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "In this tradition or in these universities?" : (00:13:51.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "There was a movement towards social and political resistance against apartheid," : (00:13:53.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "against discrimination." : (00:13:59.223)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so that can be seen sort of arising in what were traditionally sort of more" : (00:14:02.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "English speaking universities. However, you will see in the study guide that" : (00:14:08.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "there's also a lot of contestation." : (00:14:14.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a lot of critique of this idea because it was argued that." : (00:14:17.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "A lot of political resistance came out of these universities that there were people" : (00:14:23.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "sort of standing up against discrimination and against apartheid" : (00:14:29.952)
**Westman, Claire** : "ideologies, but very often." : (00:14:35.123)
**Westman, Claire** : "In reality, that wasn't really the situation." : (00:14:38.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "It was still this ongoing discrimination, this ongoing hierarchy in the" : (00:14:41.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "universities that privileged white people that privileged Western ideologies over" : (00:14:46.401)
**Westman, Claire** : "African ideologies." : (00:14:52.051)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're privileged." : (00:14:54.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "The colonizers, rather than making a real move towards" : (00:14:56.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "decolonization, towards." : (00:15:02.414)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of going against discrimination and going against." : (00:15:06.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "The subordination of indigenous or black people in South Africa." : (00:15:11.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are just the sort of main traditions that came into South Africa." : (00:15:18.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "When philosophy was first introduced into universities." : (00:15:25.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "Go read through that section." : (00:15:30.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's not imperative." : (00:15:32.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's not vital for your assignment, but it can help you to sort of have the" : (00:15:34.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "background or the the groundwork for why Western philosophy became so dominant in" : (00:15:40.502)
**Westman, Claire** : "South African philosoph philosophy departments in the 1st place," : (00:15:47.431)
**Westman, Claire** : "but also for why." : (00:15:52.924)
**Westman, Claire** : "It might still be problematic K, because if." : (00:15:54.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "These traditions are still sort of the foundation of philosophy departments" : (00:16:00.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy curricula today." : (00:16:06.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are they still contributing towards?" : (00:16:09.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "The undermining of African knowledge systems," : (00:16:14.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "are they still contributing to privileging Western knowledge over?" : (00:16:17.505)
**Westman, Claire** : "African knowledge." : (00:16:23.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are they still perpetuating the ideas?" : (00:16:24.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "That came when they were first introduced in South Africa in Africa." : (00:16:30.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, I've got a bit of a cough today." : (00:16:36.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:16:40.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's sort of just to help you have that foundation for understanding." : (00:16:40.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:16:47.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously, over time there has been a lot of change" : (00:16:49.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "in philosophy curricula." : (00:16:52.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's been a lot of change in philosophy departments." : (00:16:53.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's been a move towards trying to bring in more African philosophy to" : (00:16:56.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "trying to do away with a lot of the sort of hierarchies and the discrimination." : (00:17:02.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "That was present, but it's for you to think about." : (00:17:09.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "Has this happened?" : (00:17:13.396)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our philosophy departments you might." : (00:17:16.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "You obviously might not have a lot of." : (00:17:18.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "Experience with philosophy departments, but thinking about it," : (00:17:22.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "do you think that we have made a move?" : (00:17:27.391)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what this has led to is that in contemporary philosophy departments," : (00:17:30.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "contemporary philosophy curriculums just contemporary philosophy in general." : (00:17:35.071)
**Westman, Claire** : "African experiences have been disregarded in favor of Western experiences." : (00:17:41.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western Knowledge Systems, Western beliefs." : (00:17:47.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "This means that African philosophy remains largely marginalized or devalued." : (00:17:51.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it's often seen as an inferior alternative to Western philosophy." : (00:17:59.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "So even where African philosophy is offered at universities, often it is." : (00:18:03.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is considered to be sort of and you'll see it says this in the study guide," : (00:18:09.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "like in quotes and quotes." : (00:18:14.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "An exotic option rather than the main philosophy that you study." : (00:18:16.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's like it's sort of an alternative to Western philosophy," : (00:18:21.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "which is considered the main or predominant philosophy." : (00:18:26.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "So African philosophy remains undervalued. It remains marginal." : (00:18:30.358)
**Westman, Claire** : "It remains considered inferior to Western philosophy." : (00:18:35.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously this is tied to racist ideas around the humanity and rationality" : (00:18:40.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "of Africans." : (00:18:46.326)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you are doing introduction to African philosophy as well." : (00:18:47.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will there learn quite a lot about how a lot of the reason that African" : (00:18:53.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy is still marginalized and devalued is because of this ongoing" : (00:18:59.496)
**Westman, Claire** : "colonial racist idea that African people." : (00:19:05.582)
**Westman, Claire** : "Cannot use rationality." : (00:19:09.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "African people cannot reason as well as Western people as well as white people," : (00:19:11.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "so this is an awful ongoing racist idea that continues to play into the reason" : (00:19:17.562)
**Westman, Claire** : "that African philosophy is." : (00:19:23.933)
**Westman, Claire** : "Considered marginal?" : (00:19:27.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "Always considered as inferior to Western philosophy." : (00:19:28.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously there's been a lot of change around those ideas has been a lot of" : (00:19:32.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "progress." : (00:19:36.825)
**Westman, Claire** : "Towards moving away from those ideas, but some of the reason why African" : (00:19:38.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy is still not considered as important as Western philosophy ties into." : (00:19:43.808)
**Westman, Claire** : "The the ideologies associated with African reason and rationality." : (00:19:51.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "Team. So in order for philosophy to be" : (00:19:56.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "liberated and to be considered." : (00:20:01.082)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know as important or even or as valuable or." : (00:20:05.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "To sort of have as important a place in philosophy as does Western philosophy." : (00:20:12.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is argued that African philosophy should become the lens or the framework" : (00:20:18.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "through which other philosophical traditions are viewed and engaged with." : (00:20:23.812)
**Westman, Claire** : "As it currently stands." : (00:20:28.487)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western philosophy is considered the framework or the the lens through which" : (00:20:31.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "we view African philosophy." : (00:20:36.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we use Western philosophical frameworks or ideas to understand Africa" : (00:20:38.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "and African philosophy." : (00:20:45.077)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I see a very good question in the chat, which we're going to get to." : (00:20:47.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "Which we're going to think about now as we move through these." : (00:20:54.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's a very good question." : (00:20:59.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:21:02.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you are answering the question, let's just go back and look at the" : (00:21:06.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "question again when you're answering the question," : (00:21:11.511)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're asked to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks or negatives of" : (00:21:14.803)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritizing Western philosophical thought in this context." : (00:21:19.838)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what it's asking you to do is to think about why it might be justifiable." : (00:21:24.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "And a good thing." : (00:21:32.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "To continue to prioritize Western thought." : (00:21:34.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "And White might not be." : (00:21:38.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's look at some of the value of Western philosophy." : (00:21:39.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Western philosophy." : (00:21:46.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can provide us with studying Western philosophy like you are in this module." : (00:21:49.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can give insights into and knowledge of theories that are very prominent in" : (00:21:53.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy globally." : (00:21:58.102)
**Westman, Claire** : "They can then be applied to African." : (00:22:00.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "Challenges, context, realities." : (00:22:03.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously, Western philosophy is there's a lot more" : (00:22:06.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "access to the writings of Western philosophy," : (00:22:09.973)
**Westman, Claire** : "and that is one of the reasons it's also become sort of more dominant is because" : (00:22:13.257)
**Westman, Claire** : "we have more access to the recordings of Western philosophers," : (00:22:19.041)
**Westman, Claire** : "the writings of Western philosophers." : (00:22:23.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we can argue that." : (00:22:26.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western philosophy gives us theories. It gives us information." : (00:22:30.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it gives us frameworks that we can use and that we can apply to African" : (00:22:34.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "challenges." : (00:22:40.371)
**Westman, Claire** : "Context live realities." : (00:22:41.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "We can adapt them in order to make them relevant to our situations, our contexts." : (00:22:43.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's one thing you might argue in in favour of Western philosophy." : (00:22:51.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "Another thing is that the conceptual tools and frameworks, as I said," : (00:22:57.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "are recognized." : (00:23:02.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "Understood and applied globally. So if you want to or currently as it is," : (00:23:04.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "if you want to engage in philosophy on a global level, often you need." : (00:23:09.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, generally you need to have an" : (00:23:14.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "understanding." : (00:23:16.843)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of those dominant theories and frameworks, in order to be able to contribute to the" : (00:23:19.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "global philosophical discourse." : (00:23:25.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then obviously these are also applied to many other fields like law." : (00:23:29.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "So to engage in philosophy on a global level," : (00:23:33.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "you have to have that foundational knowledge that comes from Western" : (00:23:36.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy." : (00:23:40.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we are then able to adapt that to the African context." : (00:23:42.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that is why you might argue that Western philosophy is still valued." : (00:23:46.406)
**Westman, Claire** : "Whether you then say that it should be prioritized over African philosophy in an" : (00:23:51.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "African context is another question." : (00:23:56.844)
**Westman, Claire** : "So remember when you're answering this question." : (00:24:00.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can say yes it is justifiable and it is desirable to prioritize Western" : (00:24:04.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy and then you give reasons." : (00:24:11.128)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might say no we should." : (00:24:14.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "Absolutely not." : (00:24:16.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "Prioritize Western philosophy and you can give reasons or you can give a more" : (00:24:20.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "neutral stance where you can say." : (00:24:26.495)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, there is value to Western philosophy." : (00:24:29.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "So This is why we should still incorporate and have a focus on Western" : (00:24:32.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy, but at the same time, there must be much more focus and" : (00:24:38.745)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritization of African philosophy." : (00:24:44.525)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that remember there's no one correct answer for these questions." : (00:24:49.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "You need to consider what your stance is." : (00:24:54.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then you need to develop an argument that supports that argument." : (00:24:59.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "That claim that you are making OK." : (00:25:04.443)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's what we are looking for when we mark your work." : (00:25:06.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you taken a stance?" : (00:25:11.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you made a claim? So for example, your claim might be no." : (00:25:12.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "We must get rid of Western philosophy." : (00:25:16.942)
**Westman, Claire** : "This. OK. That's a very, very strong claim," : (00:25:19.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "and you'd need a very good." : (00:25:21.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "Argument to support that, but you might say no." : (00:25:25.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "Get rid of Western philosophy entirely." : (00:25:27.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Be." : (00:25:28.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "We then want to see that you have made a very valid, good," : (00:25:29.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "strong argument to support that claim, OK." : (00:25:34.637)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we don't." : (00:25:38.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "We don't." : (00:25:39.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're not marking you on which answer you give." : (00:25:40.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's on how you answer the question, OK?" : (00:25:42.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you're answering this question, you might say this is the value of" : (00:25:46.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western philosophy." : (00:25:49.292)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is why it should be prioritized." : (00:25:50.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or this is the value of Western philosophy, and even though it has value." : (00:25:52.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "In an African context." : (00:25:57.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or even globally, African philosophy should be prioritized" : (00:25:59.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "For these reasons." : (00:26:03.527)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:26:06.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see a lot of questions or comments coming in," : (00:26:06.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "so we'll look at them once we are finished with this question." : (00:26:08.881)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some of the suggestions that you might consider when thinking about prioritising" : (00:26:12.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "African philosophy is that the ongoing prioritization of Western philosophy." : (00:26:18.726)
**Westman, Claire** : "Continues to uphold the idea that Africans." : (00:26:26.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "Aren't capable of engaging in rational philosophical thought," : (00:26:29.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "so remember that goes back to what I said earlier." : (00:26:33.008)
**Westman, Claire** : "Prioritising Western philosophy can also lead to the neglect or distortion of" : (00:26:37.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "indigenous knowledge and therefore African philosophy should be prioritized" : (00:26:43.566)
**Westman, Claire** : "in African context or even more globally." : (00:26:49.662)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can argue whichever." : (00:26:52.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because when we are applying." : (00:26:56.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western knowledge to the African context, that means that we are not always" : (00:27:00.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "considering indigenous knowledge." : (00:27:05.523)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or knowledge or belief systems." : (00:27:09.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or frameworks that come out of Africa." : (00:27:12.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sometimes we just sort of adapting African knowledge or African beliefs to" : (00:27:15.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "the Western framework. So we might say that we want to" : (00:27:21.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritize African philosophy as a way to." : (00:27:25.053)
**Westman, Claire** : "Prioritize." : (00:27:29.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "Indigenous knowledge as a way to make sure that we don't neglect or distort" : (00:27:30.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "African beliefs." : (00:27:36.295)
**Westman, Claire** : "African knowledge systems, the knowledge and theories that are" : (00:27:37.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "coming out of Africa." : (00:27:42.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "And of course, I'm sure you've heard the word decolonize" : (00:27:45.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "before." : (00:27:49.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the focus, we could argue that the focus should be" : (00:27:51.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "on African philosophy as a way to decolonize the curriculums and enhance" : (00:27:54.227)
**Westman, Claire** : "the discourse, the philosophical." : (00:27:58.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "Knowledge that comes from Africa." : (00:28:00.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "These are just some suggestions for what you could include in your answer." : (00:28:04.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are not all of them, OK." : (00:28:10.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you are going to, as I say, think about what your answer to that is." : (00:28:12.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it sustainable?" : (00:28:17.694)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can this continue in an African context?" : (00:28:19.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can we continue to prioritize Western philosophy when it might not be focusing?" : (00:28:23.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "On African challenges, African." : (00:28:30.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it ethically desirable?" : (00:28:34.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "So here in terms of ethically desirable, we think about ethically," : (00:28:36.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "is it OK to prioritise Western philosophy in, for example," : (00:28:42.001)
**Westman, Claire** : "South Africa when it is distorting indigenous knowledge?" : (00:28:46.695)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it ethically desirable or is it OK ethically OK to prioritise Western" : (00:28:51.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy?" : (00:28:57.696)
**Westman, Claire** : "When one of the ways it was used was to justify discrimination," : (00:28:59.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "has that changed over time?" : (00:29:05.374)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are some of the things that you're going to be thinking about when" : (00:29:09.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "you answer this assignment." : (00:29:13.768)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are some ideas of what you might consider when you are coming up with your" : (00:29:15.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "answer." : (00:29:20.154)
**Westman, Claire** : "Obviously you're all going to give us a different answer," : (00:29:20.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "and that's like the amazing thing about philosophy, everybody." : (00:29:24.074)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of gets." : (00:29:28.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "To their own idea and their own claims and their own arguments." : (00:29:29.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we just want to see that you have thought carefully about." : (00:29:33.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those how you feel about those if it's ethically justifiable and if it's" : (00:29:38.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "sustainable." : (00:29:42.707)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some things you could think about, I think we won't focus on it too much now" : (00:29:44.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "because of time, but you might think about how would you" : (00:29:50.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "define African philosophy?" : (00:29:54.967)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do you think that African philosophy is prioritised in universities?" : (00:29:58.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously again your first year, first semester some of you have done" : (00:30:02.941)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy, maybe at other institutions before you" : (00:30:07.565)
**Westman, Claire** : "moved to UNICEF." : (00:30:10.751)
**Westman, Claire** : "But from the little but you know, do you think African philosophy is" : (00:30:12.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritized?" : (00:30:17.303)
**Westman, Claire** : "Should African philosophy department or should philosophy departments in Africa" : (00:30:18.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "focus on Western philosophy or should they focus more on African philosophy?" : (00:30:24.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "Should Western philosophy be sort of the alternative and African philosophy be the" : (00:30:30.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "main?" : (00:30:36.632)
**Westman, Claire** : "Philosophical framework." : (00:30:37.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "The main philosophical discourse." : (00:30:39.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "In the departments and how can African philosophy contribute to improving social" : (00:30:41.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "political economic conditions in Africa?" : (00:30:48.824)
**Westman, Claire** : "In South Africa, if you wanted to be more specific." : (00:30:52.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:30:56.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "So those that's a bit of the content that you will need in order to answer question" : (00:30:57.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "one, let me look quickly at the chat in the if" : (00:31:03.198)
**Westman, Claire** : "you have any questions." : (00:31:06.604)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please ask them." : (00:31:10.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can put your hand up or you can ask him in the chat." : (00:31:12.690)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. So our first comment says, don't you think in a way Western" : (00:31:15.570)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy will forever be dominant considering at the foundation of" : (00:31:19.733)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy was founded by colonizers and we have adopted and lived the way of the" : (00:31:24.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "West, it would be considerably hard to actually" : (00:31:29.553)
**Westman, Claire** : "know and establish African." : (00:31:32.674)
**Westman, Claire** : "Philosophy, unless we dig into the history books," : (00:31:34.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "which would take time to find out the truth of African philosophy." : (00:31:36.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is a very good point, and that's something that you can" : (00:31:40.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "consider." : (00:31:42.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "While you are doing your assignment." : (00:31:43.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:31:46.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "A lot of the argument is also that." : (00:31:48.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "Even people doing African philosophy have been trained in Western philosophy." : (00:31:53.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "So many, even prominent African philosophers were" : (00:32:00.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "trained in institutions." : (00:32:04.657)
**Westman, Claire** : "That only taught Western philosophy, so there's always that argument that even" : (00:32:08.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "prominent African philosophers are influenced by Western philosophy." : (00:32:13.528)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's a very important point." : (00:32:18.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a very good point." : (00:32:22.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "And of course, the some of the challenge that we find" : (00:32:25.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "with African philosophy is that a lot of it was passed down through oral" : (00:32:28.606)
**Westman, Claire** : "traditions rather than through writing. And so that's one of the reasons that" : (00:32:33.007)
**Westman, Claire** : "African philosophies, the history of African philosophy," : (00:32:37.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "can be a bit more." : (00:32:41.145)
**Westman, Claire** : "Difficult to dig into because there aren't the written records that there are" : (00:32:42.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "for Western philosophy." : (00:32:46.586)
**Westman, Claire** : "However, there is a lot of work being done." : (00:32:48.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "In Africa." : (00:32:52.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "Philosophy." : (00:32:52.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "To go back into looking into indigenous knowledge systems into developing African" : (00:32:54.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy." : (00:33:01.456)
**Westman, Claire** : "That." : (00:33:04.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "Goes back to some pre colonial ideas, some pre colonial beliefs and of course" : (00:33:05.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "again even that is tricky because we know that colonialism impacted upon." : (00:33:12.733)
**Westman, Claire** : "Cultures and beliefs and traditions so immensely." : (00:33:21.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "But this is getting to a much more complex discussion, but very," : (00:33:26.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "very interesting one." : (00:33:31.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that is a very good comment." : (00:33:33.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "So thank you very much." : (00:33:36.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "I think that's something that everybody should kind of think about." : (00:33:37.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it possible?" : (00:33:41.375)
**Westman, Claire** : "To move away from." : (00:33:43.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or or to sort of not rely on Western philosophy, at least at this stage." : (00:33:47.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it possible to only look at African philosophy?" : (00:33:53.383)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because if we think about things like epistemology, metaphysics, ontology," : (00:33:57.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "a lot of those ideas." : (00:34:04.027)
**Westman, Claire** : "Most of those sort of frameworks or theories stem from Western philosophy," : (00:34:06.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "or at least we learn them through a western philosophical lens," : (00:34:12.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "because that's what we have written records of." : (00:34:16.797)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there are many arguments about that." : (00:34:21.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "But again, we won't go into that." : (00:34:23.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "But can we even do African philosophy, let's say," : (00:34:25.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "without having that foundation that we gain from Western philosophy?" : (00:34:28.705)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's something for you to think about very carefully." : (00:34:32.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:34:38.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh yes." : (00:34:38.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then the next comment." : (00:34:39.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western philosophy did dilute African culture." : (00:34:40.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, absolutely." : (00:34:43.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "The the arrival of colonizers diluted and distorted and impacted so greatly upon" : (00:34:46.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "African culture." : (00:34:53.484)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so it's also even difficult to know now what traditions, beliefs," : (00:34:55.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "cultures were like pre colonial." : (00:35:01.066)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, because a lot of it has been handed down" : (00:35:03.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "orally." : (00:35:06.793)
**Westman, Claire** : "And over time, so a lot of it has changed." : (00:35:08.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm just gonna mute everybody. Somebody's mark is on." : (00:35:14.100)
**CASHENY LAMOLA** : "Yeah." : (00:35:17.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "I do see your. I did see your hand up, but I see it's down now." : (00:35:18.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, let me just go back here." : (00:35:24.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you argue that it's not ethically desirable for Western philosophy to" : (00:35:28.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "maintain its dominance, are you meant to argue that it's rather" : (00:35:32.505)
**Westman, Claire** : "ethically desirable that African philosophy is dominant," : (00:35:36.147)
**Westman, Claire** : "or that neither should be?" : (00:35:39.391)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can't, yes." : (00:35:41.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, you can say that neither should be" : (00:35:43.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "dominant, that there should be a balance between" : (00:35:47.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "Western philosophy and African philosophy." : (00:35:50.656)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can absolutely argue that you don't have to say just because you say Western" : (00:35:53.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy shouldn't be dominant. African philosophy," : (00:35:59.252)
**Westman, Claire** : "should you do not have to say that you can." : (00:36:02.973)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you can say African philosophy and Western philosophy." : (00:36:06.005)
**Westman, Claire** : "Should both be valued." : (00:36:10.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "There should be a balance between them because both of them bring value to the" : (00:36:11.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy departments to philosophy discourse." : (00:36:16.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "Both of them have important knowledge." : (00:36:19.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "That can be imparted. OK, so I hope that answers the question." : (00:36:22.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "Question one." : (00:36:28.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can only use the study guide for reference." : (00:36:28.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can only use the study guide if you find the information in there is all that" : (00:36:30.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "you need in order to answer the question. So remember." : (00:36:35.835)
**Westman, Claire** : "The study guide is your main source." : (00:36:40.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you must reference the study guide if you want to look for other sources," : (00:36:44.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "because you need more information." : (00:36:48.553)
**Westman, Claire** : "Than you are." : (00:36:51.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can do that, but if you find for this assignment that" : (00:36:52.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "the study guide is all you need, then you can just focus on the study" : (00:36:56.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "guide for assessment two. You will need to look at other sources" : (00:37:01.107)
**Westman, Claire** : "and include evidence from other sources as well." : (00:37:05.534)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, how can you reference me?" : (00:37:14.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can reference the recording if you want to," : (00:37:16.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "but also remember a lot of these ideas come from the study guide." : (00:37:19.814)
**Westman, Claire** : "And if you do research, you will also find a lot of these ideas" : (00:37:26.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "in the research, OK?" : (00:37:29.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are my necessary my ideas." : (00:37:31.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are ideas that you will also find in in research," : (00:37:36.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "but you can reference the recording if you like." : (00:37:39.791)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can you argue that Western philosophy taught on the African continent has been" : (00:37:47.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "influenced by African culture? Given given the forces amalgamation of" : (00:37:52.208)
**Westman, Claire** : "indigenous with the colonizers?" : (00:37:56.486)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, absolutely." : (00:37:58.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you want to argue that Western philosophy has been when it was brought" : (00:37:59.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "to the African continent, it was influenced by African culture." : (00:38:04.881)
**Westman, Claire** : "It has been influenced by indigenous knowledge systems or African knowledge" : (00:38:09.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "and beliefs." : (00:38:14.027)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can argue that that's a very interesting point as well." : (00:38:15.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "So remember again." : (00:38:19.682)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can develop any argument that you feel answers those questions," : (00:38:22.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "or any that does answer those questions. As long as you show how you got to that" : (00:38:27.663)
**Westman, Claire** : "argument. As long as you've got the reference" : (00:38:33.468)
**Westman, Claire** : "evidence in there to support your claim." : (00:38:36.764)
**Westman, Claire** : "S." : (00:38:39.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can I reference a YouTube video?" : (00:38:43.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can reference a YouTube video. Just make sure that it is a credible" : (00:38:45.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "source." : (00:38:50.163)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there are for example, some that are done by professors." : (00:38:50.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "In philosophy, there are some that are done by." : (00:38:54.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of learning institution." : (00:38:59.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "So make sure it's those OK." : (00:39:00.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can we agree African philosophy should be dominant in African communities and not" : (00:39:06.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "all over the world?" : (00:39:10.025)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, yes, you can do that." : (00:39:10.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because again, if we're saying we're looking at" : (00:39:13.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "challenges in, let's say, for example, Ukraine, because they, you know," : (00:39:17.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "in a war at the moment." : (00:39:23.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "The information the knowledge from Africa, maybe we could say is not really relevant" : (00:39:26.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "to their context." : (00:39:29.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "Theirs is more sort of Eastern European philosophy or European philosophy is more" : (00:39:32.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "relevant to them. So you might say that in Africa," : (00:39:37.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "African philosophy." : (00:39:40.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "Should." : (00:39:42.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "Dominant but not everywhere." : (00:39:45.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:39:51.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some really, really good points here." : (00:39:53.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes. So another very good point here from" : (00:40:00.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "Allison at the end." : (00:40:04.003)
**Westman, Claire** : "African philosophy existed before Western philosophy," : (00:40:05.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "but there's no written record of it." : (00:40:08.366)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very, very good point." : (00:40:10.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:40:13.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let me just I'm not going to go through everything because we're running out of" : (00:40:13.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "time already. Do we have to have a bibliography?" : (00:40:17.313)
**Westman, Claire** : "Three, yes, absolutely. In text referencing and bibliography," : (00:40:19.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "is it OK to paraphrase information from AI? No." : (00:40:24.298)
**Westman, Claire** : "Reference AI no, OK." : (00:40:29.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "The university has a strict policy against using AI." : (00:40:35.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can use AI maybe to give you an idea of how you want to structure your answer," : (00:40:38.755)
**Westman, Claire** : "what you want to include." : (00:40:44.385)
**Westman, Claire** : "But AI is very unreliable." : (00:40:46.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "Still so often it will give you very vague information." : (00:40:48.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sometimes it gives you incorrect information." : (00:40:56.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there are many, many, many sources that you can use." : (00:40:59.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please don't rely on AI." : (00:41:03.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's like Wikipedia. You can use it as a starting point to" : (00:41:06.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "give you if you don't know anything about the topic, you can use it as an idea." : (00:41:09.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of sort of help you get an idea of the topic to help you sort of get your mind" : (00:41:14.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "around it, to think about how to structure your" : (00:41:18.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignment." : (00:41:21.392)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you should not be actually taking information from an AR source, OK?" : (00:41:22.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "So be very, very careful of that. And for example, in assignment two," : (00:41:27.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "when you use turnitin." : (00:41:31.353)
**Westman, Claire** : "It picks up if you've used AI OK." : (00:41:33.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's very it's a contentious topic, but please rather look for good" : (00:41:36.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "information." : (00:41:44.176)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anything that you find on an AR source is going to be in a credible source." : (00:41:45.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "So my suggestion is also you can start with the AR to get an idea," : (00:41:50.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "but go look for those credible sources." : (00:41:56.311)
**Westman, Claire** : "That then help you to back up that information." : (00:42:00.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "And make sure you're referencing the credible sources, OK." : (00:42:03.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can if you if you OK." : (00:42:09.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's no OK." : (00:42:12.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's very tricky and it's beyond the scope of this meeting," : (00:42:13.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I'll just leave it at that for now, OK." : (00:42:17.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, that's what I'm saying." : (00:42:23.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is that you can use AI as a way to help you start off your understanding," : (00:42:25.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "but it's not the information you should not be actually using that information in" : (00:42:32.145)
**Westman, Claire** : "your work." : (00:42:39.574)
**Westman, Claire** : "You use it to give you a general first idea of what the topic is about," : (00:42:40.600)
**Westman, Claire** : "so you can." : (00:42:45.771)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's the same as Wikipedia." : (00:42:46.600)
**Westman, Claire** : "You cannot reference Wikipedia in." : (00:42:47.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "Academic work. It's not academic." : (00:42:50.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anybody can write anything on there, but you can go read Wikipedia to get an" : (00:42:53.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "idea of what the topic is about and then go look at the sources that Wikipedia" : (00:42:57.891)
**Westman, Claire** : "gives you and go find those sources." : (00:43:02.878)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can use AI to give you an idea to help you think about how to structure" : (00:43:06.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "your answer." : (00:43:10.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "What kind of point you might include, but then when you're referencing in your" : (00:43:11.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "work, the work you include as referenced" : (00:43:16.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "evidence needs to come from academic sources." : (00:43:18.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you do use AI to help you brainstorm to help you develop a structure," : (00:43:22.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can give credit to the AI source that you use, but it is very." : (00:43:28.028)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is a tricky situation right now, so I would suggest avoid AI as much as" : (00:43:35.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "possible." : (00:43:43.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just because what ends up happening is people submit fully AR answers," : (00:43:44.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "and then you're going to get 0OK if you submit an answer that has been generated" : (00:43:49.094)
**Westman, Claire** : "by AI, you will get 0." : (00:43:54.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "Somebody's mic is on, I think." : (00:43:57.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let me just check again." : (00:43:58.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "I keep muting them all, but people obviously keep unmuting" : (00:43:59.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "themselves." : (00:44:03.027)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beverly, your hand is up." : (00:44:05.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can unmute yourself." : (00:44:12.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beverly." : (00:44:19.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, you can use AI as a planning tool." : (00:44:27.970)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, Beverly." : (00:44:30.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "Was it an accidental hand? OK." : (00:44:31.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "We are running out of time." : (00:44:36.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "We still have a lot to do, so let's continue, but very good points." : (00:44:37.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:44:43.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've mentioned the declaration letter so many times, there is a button," : (00:44:43.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "a block that you click when you open the assignment." : (00:44:48.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "That." : (00:44:53.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "Says that you declare honesty blah blah. You click that," : (00:44:55.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "but that little block it won't let you submit the assignments until you click" : (00:44:58.583)
**Westman, Claire** : "that block. That is your honesty declaration," : (00:45:02.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "so you don't need to include an actual letter in the assignment." : (00:45:04.571)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:45:09.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:45:11.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's move on to the next question because this one is a bit trickier," : (00:45:13.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "and yet we're running out of time." : (00:45:18.157)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's get to this quickly." : (00:45:20.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this question says, drawing on the knowledge you have gained" : (00:45:22.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "about metaphysics, which means obviously you first need to" : (00:45:26.164)
**Westman, Claire** : "go and get an understanding of metaph what metaphysics is." : (00:45:29.652)
**Westman, Claire** : "Explain why the Elysian philosophers should be called metaphysicians." : (00:45:33.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can refer to unit two of the study guide." : (00:45:39.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, this is asking you about metaphysics," : (00:45:42.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "and it's asking you about the malesian philosophers." : (00:45:46.046)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the pre Socratic philosophers and it needs you to explain." : (00:45:50.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why? It could be said that malesian" : (00:45:57.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophers fell under the bracket of metaphysics," : (00:46:00.121)
**Westman, Claire** : "while the philosophy they did could be considered metaphysics." : (00:46:03.372)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in order to answer this question." : (00:46:07.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "You first need to." : (00:46:11.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Explain what metaphysics is." : (00:46:12.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "You first need to understand what metaphysics is so." : (00:46:14.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just as a note for this question, you will need to look at Pages 8 to 10 of" : (00:46:20.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "the study guide because that tells you a little bit about epistemology and" : (00:46:25.671)
**Westman, Claire** : "metaphysics." : (00:46:30.843)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you will probably need to go do your own bit of research about metaphysics for" : (00:46:31.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "this question." : (00:46:37.221)
**Westman, Claire** : "But page 8 to 10 of the study guide." : (00:46:38.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then the information about the Malaysian philosophers is on page 23 to" : (00:46:41.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "31." : (00:46:47.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's the focus for of the study guide for this question. For question one," : (00:46:47.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "I didn't mention this then 12 pages 12 to 21 are where you should focus your" : (00:46:53.686)
**Westman, Claire** : "attention." : (00:46:59.275)
**Westman, Claire** : "For question one, OK." : (00:47:01.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there's a hand up Luanda." : (00:47:03.150)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Yeah. Sorry, ma'am. I just missed the second set of pages for" : (00:47:08.270)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "mesophysics." : (00:47:12.795)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:47:14.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's pages 8 to 10." : (00:47:14.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "And pages 23 to 31." : (00:47:18.110)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (00:47:18.460)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (00:47:23.450)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Thank you." : (00:47:23.850)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a pleasure." : (00:47:24.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so to define metaphysics is quite tricky." : (00:47:26.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's no single definition of metaphysics, and it's changed over time." : (00:47:31.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what might have been considered metaphysics at one point?" : (00:47:35.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "So sort of. During the ancient Greek philosoph" : (00:47:40.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophers time, it sort of changed somewhat." : (00:47:43.938)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some of it is the same. There's been sort of additional ideas of" : (00:47:47.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "what constitutes metaphysics or what falls under metaphysics." : (00:47:50.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it has changed over time." : (00:47:55.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this is 1 aspect of this question that might be a little bit tricky for you," : (00:47:56.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "but let's look at some of the definitions that we can find through doing a bit of" : (00:48:02.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "research on the Internet so metaphysics can generally most generally it's" : (00:48:08.442)
**Westman, Claire** : "understood as OK, I hope." : (00:48:13.696)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can hear me." : (00:48:15.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a weed eater that's really loud outside." : (00:48:15.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's generally understood as the branch of philosophy that examines the" : (00:48:20.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "fundamental nature of reality." : (00:48:25.571)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's another hand." : (00:48:29.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "Arpa C is a question for now." : (00:48:31.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, OK." : (00:48:36.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm going to come back to questions at the end." : (00:48:37.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:48:39.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's just get through this and then we'll deal with questions at the end." : (00:48:39.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's generally the branch of philosophy that examines fundamental" : (00:48:46.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "nature of reality." : (00:48:50.137)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what do we understand by reality?" : (00:48:51.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "What sort of things are real?" : (00:48:54.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "What do we know about what's real?" : (00:48:57.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "So other definitions that might make this a bit clearer for you are it's the study" : (00:48:59.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "of the nature of reality or of what sort of things are real," : (00:49:06.152)
**Westman, Claire** : "but seeks to understand basic criteria or first principles for determining what" : (00:49:10.688)
**Westman, Claire** : "sort of things are real." : (00:49:16.636)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it can address topics such as space and time." : (00:49:19.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Time determinism and free will, God minded matter," : (00:49:22.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "identity and change and more so you can see it's very broad metaphysics and we" : (00:49:26.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "know it incorporates." : (00:49:33.425)
**Westman, Claire** : "Other branches of philosophy." : (00:49:36.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "Another definition says it is the science that studies being as such," : (00:49:39.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "or the first causes of things." : (00:49:45.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "So now some of these things I've highlighted will be important for this" : (00:49:47.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "question." : (00:49:50.822)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or things that do not change." : (00:49:52.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "The final one I've got here is it's a division of philosophy that is concerned" : (00:49:55.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "with the fundamental nature of reality and being." : (00:50:00.632)
**Westman, Claire** : "It includes ontology, cosmology and often epistemology." : (00:50:03.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a study of what is outside objective experience, so it's trying to understand." : (00:50:09.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "What? What constitutes reality?" : (00:50:17.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "What things are real?" : (00:50:21.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "What makes up those things that are real?" : (00:50:24.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "What are the sort of substances that we can understand for things that are real," : (00:50:26.790)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:50:32.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what makes up our reality?" : (00:50:32.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "And very importantly, here is to take note of things like the" : (00:50:36.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "first causes of things, because as we are going to see," : (00:50:41.213)
**Westman, Claire** : "that is the focus of Malaysian philosophy was trying to understand the causes of" : (00:50:45.758)
**Westman, Claire** : "things." : (00:50:52.332)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is it that causes something to be something to exist?" : (00:50:53.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "How do we understand the world that we are living in? How do we understand?" : (00:51:00.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "The things around us." : (00:51:06.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "How how do we understand the fundamental nature?" : (00:51:10.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is it that gives things the fundamental nature?" : (00:51:14.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "What? What is the substance that makes things" : (00:51:17.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "real or gives us our nature?" : (00:51:21.023)
**Westman, Claire** : "Gives us reality." : (00:51:23.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "So go and do some research on metaphysics." : (00:51:26.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "And there are also lots of videos that you can watch." : (00:51:30.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "That will help you, OK." : (00:51:35.690)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've included some suggested sources at the towards the end of the slides that" : (00:51:37.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can use also to help you. OK, we are definitely going to go over time" : (00:51:42.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "here, so I hope that's OK with everybody. Obviously," : (00:51:46.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "if you need to leave then you're welcome to leave." : (00:51:49.987)
**Westman, Claire** : "Hey, catch up on the recording. Next week's class will be short." : (00:51:55.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because just one question." : (00:51:59.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:52:01.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "So an overview of the Malaysian." : (00:52:01.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "They called sort of the Ironian school or the museum because it from they were from" : (00:52:06.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "Malaysia." : (00:52:11.946)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that was part of Ancient Greece." : (00:52:15.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "It would actually be part of Turkey now, but that's not so important for you to" : (00:52:16.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "know now." : (00:52:21.435)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the the main thing that the Malaysians were doing was trying to move away from" : (00:52:24.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "myth and superstition." : (00:52:29.314)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there were many mythological understandings of the nature of the world" : (00:52:30.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "and of things that we experienced. They experienced in the world a lot of" : (00:52:36.267)
**Westman, Claire** : "their understanding of those stem from myth, from superstition," : (00:52:41.704)
**Westman, Claire** : "from ideas around the gods." : (00:52:46.407)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the Malaysians were trying to move away from that to have a more rational" : (00:52:49.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "understanding." : (00:52:53.134)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of what they were experiencing or the things they could observe," : (00:52:54.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "the patterns they could observe that were happening around them in the world." : (00:52:59.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "So, for example, myth had been used to explain many" : (00:53:05.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "natural phenomena. Let's say, for example Thunder." : (00:53:08.624)
**Westman, Claire** : "Mythologically or during those times it might have been explained that Thunder" : (00:53:14.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "was caused by God's the various gods anger." : (00:53:20.395)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:53:24.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's where Thunder might have come from." : (00:53:24.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "They had many gods to explain the different natural phenomena." : (00:53:28.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the Malaysians wanted to have these more rational moving towards scientific" : (00:53:31.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "understandings of an explanations for national natural phenomena." : (00:53:37.203)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for example, they could see that there was these" : (00:53:41.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "patterns like the tides coming in and out." : (00:53:45.063)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they didn't." : (00:53:48.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "They thought that there was rational explanations for why the tides came in" : (00:53:49.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "and out." : (00:53:53.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "Out, rather than saying that it was because of" : (00:53:54.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "the gods or some other, some other kind of superstitious reason" : (00:53:57.367)
**Westman, Claire** : "or mythological reason that the tides moved in and out," : (00:54:01.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "they wanted to have a more rational understanding of that." : (00:54:04.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know, they might have also seen the crops grew" : (00:54:10.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "at certain times of the year where in mythologically that might have been that" : (00:54:13.448)
**Westman, Claire** : "would have been attributed to one of the gods, you know," : (00:54:17.518)
**Westman, Claire** : "blessing the harvest and the crops sprouting during that time." : (00:54:20.455)
**Westman, Claire** : "The Malaysian philosophers wanted to understand what is it?" : (00:54:24.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "About nature or these phenomena that causes the crops to arise at that time." : (00:54:30.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they wanted to develop a more rational understanding." : (00:54:35.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the fundamental question that the Malaysians asked is what is the first" : (00:54:40.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "governing principle of the world by which chaos." : (00:54:45.191)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is turned into Cosmos or intelligible matter." : (00:54:49.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is the the thing that underlies?" : (00:54:52.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is the substance that underlies everything that gives it?" : (00:54:55.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "That gives patterns that contribute to it being understandable?" : (00:55:00.231)
**Westman, Claire** : "So going from sort of just seeing all these wild, random, unintelligible," : (00:55:05.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "chaotic aspects of nature of natural phenomena, all these while, you know," : (00:55:10.575)
**Westman, Claire** : "unformed things happening around us in the natural world." : (00:55:15.851)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is the thing that governs that?" : (00:55:20.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "That gives an order that makes it intelligible that forms it," : (00:55:22.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "that brings it together." : (00:55:27.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that is what they were trying to understand." : (00:55:29.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they wanted to understand what it was that governed observable patterns or from" : (00:55:33.181)
**Westman, Claire** : "which natural phenomena and consequently nature of being emerged." : (00:55:39.146)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they wanted to understand what was the underlying substance." : (00:55:44.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "That led to or governed observable patterns or that led." : (00:55:48.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "Two natural phenomena that they could observe," : (00:55:52.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "so they get sought to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature" : (00:55:55.943)
**Westman, Claire** : "of reality." : (00:56:01.138)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so again, they wanted to look at sort of this" : (00:56:03.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "objective thing that was outside of what they could experience." : (00:56:06.155)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what was it that underlay or underpinned all of these phenomena that" : (00:56:09.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "they could see?" : (00:56:15.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they were generally monists, which means that they believe all of" : (00:56:16.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "reality." : (00:56:21.192)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is composed of one single unifying substance." : (00:56:21.890)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we might think that these ideas." : (00:56:26.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are sort of silly now, or ludicrous when we look at the ideas" : (00:56:30.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "that they came up with." : (00:56:33.991)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we must think about the time at which they were developing these ideas." : (00:56:35.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "So like I said, a lot of the understanding of the natural" : (00:56:41.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "world of the reality was based on myth on." : (00:56:47.004)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of." : (00:56:52.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of thinking that the gods produced the phenomena," : (00:56:53.250)
**Westman, Claire** : "they saw that the gods controlled all the natural phenomena that they could see" : (00:56:56.487)
**Westman, Claire** : "happening around them." : (00:57:01.666)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that Malaysians wanted to develop this more rational idea." : (00:57:04.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "But it was at a time when not like now." : (00:57:08.446)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we have scientific explanations for a lot of what we experience." : (00:57:10.740)
**Westman, Claire** : "They didn't have those scientific explanations." : (00:57:15.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when we look at their ideas now, with the knowledge that we have." : (00:57:18.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "Now we might think they silly, but we must think about how important." : (00:57:23.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "These kind of rational inquiries or these inquiries towards a more rational" : (00:57:30.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "explanation, were at the time and how they helped move" : (00:57:35.528)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge forward and helped to contribute to sort of scientific inquiry" : (00:57:39.398)
**Westman, Claire** : "to the development of the scientific method." : (00:57:44.534)
**Westman, Claire** : "To developing these objective understandings." : (00:57:49.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of reality of how things work, of what causes the things that we can see" : (00:57:53.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "happening around us, or that we can experience." : (00:57:59.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "So instead of just our subjective experiences that we as an individual" : (00:58:03.970)
**Westman, Claire** : "experience, what is it that lays the foundation?" : (00:58:09.627)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is the foundation of these things that everybody experiences?" : (00:58:13.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "In their own way." : (00:58:18.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "But what causes these phenomena?" : (00:58:19.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "What causes this reality?" : (00:58:22.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or this the natural world around us?" : (00:58:24.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "So keep that in mind while you're working through the Malaysians because as I say" : (00:58:28.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "to us, it now seems a bit silly these ideas," : (00:58:34.057)
**Westman, Claire** : "but at the time this was, you know, a huge sort of leap in trying to" : (00:58:36.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "understand the world and trying to understand reality and." : (00:58:41.281)
**Westman, Claire** : "To have a better grasp of the nature of reality, OK?" : (00:58:45.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the first one, the first Malaysian we'll get is Thais." : (00:58:50.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "He was a mathematician and an astronomer, and he wanted to discover and explain the" : (00:58:55.850)
**Westman, Claire** : "origins, the material origins of life in the world." : (00:59:01.385)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he's had made observations of living things around him," : (00:59:06.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "and he noted that living things were either comprised of water or humidity," : (00:59:10.266)
**Westman, Claire** : "or they needed water or weakness to survive and to thrive." : (00:59:15.375)
**Westman, Claire** : "He also, by looking at all of these, the living things around him noted." : (00:59:19.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "Dying so things living, things that were dying or dead or" : (00:59:25.970)
**Westman, Claire** : "inanimate objects, say let's say." : (00:59:31.503)
**Westman, Claire** : "What Mark David had a cloth." : (00:59:36.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "They were." : (00:59:40.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "They either were dry or they became dry." : (00:59:42.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "And again, it'll explain to you in the study guide" : (00:59:45.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "that at the time they were in a very dry desert like conditions." : (00:59:47.962)
**Westman, Claire** : "So water was considered so important it was considered sort of the thing that" : (00:59:51.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "gave life." : (00:59:55.851)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when Thadis was looking at things around him that were living, he was like," : (00:59:56.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, they either are made-up of water or" : (01:00:02.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "they're humid." : (01:00:05.168)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or they need water." : (01:00:07.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or some kind of wetness in order to survive." : (01:00:08.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because of these observations he made about the importance of water." : (01:00:11.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "He determined that water was the underlying first principle." : (01:00:17.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought that water was what life originated from." : (01:00:20.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "From so he thought that water was the thing that led to the existence of" : (01:00:26.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "everything that was living in the world." : (01:00:32.495)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:00:36.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the material origin of life and the world he thought was water." : (01:00:36.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "So water formed the foundation of every living thing he believed." : (01:00:42.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "And of the world in general. And so, for example," : (01:00:47.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "he went so far as to think that the Earth rested upon water, so he." : (01:00:51.025)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thought that where earthquakes mythologically were considered to be the" : (01:00:55.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "anger of the gods, he thought that earthquakes were the" : (01:01:00.218)
**Westman, Claire** : "result of water rocking beneath the Earth." : (01:01:03.802)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought the earth was on this body of water," : (01:01:06.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "and that when the water moved and shook the earth would rock on top of it." : (01:01:09.781)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that is what an earthquake was. Again, we can see that, obviously," : (01:01:14.621)
**Westman, Claire** : "scientifically." : (01:01:19.203)
**Westman, Claire** : "We have been geologically, we've moved far beyond that understanding." : (01:01:20.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we do know that." : (01:01:26.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "But at the time, this was sort of a revolutionary idea, OK." : (01:01:30.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for Thales, the one single unifying substance." : (01:01:35.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the single unifying substance that all reality is composed of for thalese was" : (01:01:42.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "water because of the necessity of water for living things." : (01:01:48.324)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. And then the other natural phenomena" : (01:01:53.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "could be explained again by water." : (01:01:56.176)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there are some examples in the study guide that you can go look at the." : (01:01:58.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "Also if you go look online, you can find other examples," : (01:02:03.992)
**Westman, Claire** : "but for example it was water sprouting from a spring water rocking the earth," : (01:02:08.294)
**Westman, Claire** : "creating earthquakes etc. OK." : (01:02:14.181)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anax Amanda is the second one." : (01:02:18.180)
**Westman, Claire** : "We'll look at so he." : (01:02:19.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "Went against dailies because remember, dailies now thought that Earth sat on top" : (01:02:23.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "of water and anax. Amanda was actually quite ahead of his" : (01:02:29.925)
**Westman, Claire** : "time." : (01:02:34.533)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because he thought that there's nothing under the Earth supporting it." : (01:02:35.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "He thought that it floats in the centre of the universe and that what keeps it" : (01:02:39.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "floating in the centre of universe is that it's equal distance from." : (01:02:44.577)
**Westman, Claire** : "Other worlds other." : (01:02:50.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "Other." : (01:02:55.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "On my way, I'm just gonna set obstacles." : (01:02:56.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's not the word." : (01:02:58.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "Other objects in the universe, so he thought that it was at an equal" : (01:02:59.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "distance from other objects which might have been other worlds." : (01:03:03.151)
**Westman, Claire** : "And because of that sort of force on the earth from those other worlds or objects," : (01:03:06.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's what supported that." : (01:03:11.914)
**Westman, Claire** : "What kept the earth floating in the universe?" : (01:03:13.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I mean, that was such a revolutionary idea." : (01:03:16.090)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it's, you know, definitely sort of starting to work" : (01:03:18.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "towards sort of." : (01:03:23.242)
**Westman, Claire** : "Ideas of gravity and all of that?" : (01:03:25.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "But at the time it sort of just." : (01:03:27.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "Kept it simple." : (01:03:29.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "He also thought that the Earth was sort of a long tube and that the inhabitable" : (01:03:31.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "earth was almost like a plate on top of the tube." : (01:03:37.423)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, you know not a full understanding of." : (01:03:41.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "The earth, obviously, but a big leap in what was understood" : (01:03:47.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "about the Earth or the thinking about the universe and the earth." : (01:03:51.864)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Anax, Amanda didn't think that water." : (01:03:58.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "That was the stylist was his teacher." : (01:04:01.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he didn't think that water was that what Earth originated from," : (01:04:04.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "or that everything originated on from." : (01:04:08.333)
**Westman, Claire** : "Heath thought it was the a pyron, so the apparent could be understand as" : (01:04:10.570)
**Westman, Claire** : "infinite unlimited indefinite." : (01:04:15.248)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you didn't think it was one particular element?" : (01:04:17.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "Instead, he thought it was the a pyron which was" : (01:04:20.570)
**Westman, Claire** : "which he thought was this boundless." : (01:04:23.983)
**Westman, Claire** : "So just forever reaching expands of infinitely different substances." : (01:04:27.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought there was this. The universe was just this expanse." : (01:04:33.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of substances that could never be finished would never end." : (01:04:39.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "So, you know, like an infinite number and kind of" : (01:04:44.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "substances that could not be created or destroyed." : (01:04:47.428)
**Westman, Claire** : "And he thought that everything grew out of the apyron." : (01:04:50.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "So, I mean, we know the universe is sort of infinite" : (01:04:56.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "and expansive. For him it was." : (01:05:00.213)
**Westman, Claire** : "Had all these substances and in the world or earth would come," : (01:05:02.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "would be a coming together of those substances," : (01:05:06.026)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's how the earth would grow out of the appyron." : (01:05:08.476)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought that the earth that he inhabited was not." : (01:05:11.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "The only earth and he didn't think our world would always exist." : (01:05:19.420)
**Westman, Claire** : "He didn't think it had always existed because there was a number." : (01:05:23.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of worlds that would." : (01:05:29.500)
**Westman, Claire** : "Come to exist and then would not always exist and they would grow out of the" : (01:05:32.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "sapyron." : (01:05:36.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought the earth grew out of the appyron and that it wouldn't always exist." : (01:05:37.780)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that other worlds would then grow out of the apyra." : (01:05:42.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "And interestingly, he also started to think about evolution." : (01:05:47.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thought that the life that he could observe so the plants, animals, humans," : (01:05:51.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "etc. Must have originated from other life" : (01:05:57.305)
**Westman, Claire** : "forms." : (01:06:00.381)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he said that the first life forms must have originated in wetter environments" : (01:06:01.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "and then evolved into what he what existed during his time," : (01:06:06.441)
**Westman, Claire** : "what he could observe and for example, he thought that humans evolved from fish." : (01:06:10.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, very revolutionary ideas for the time" : (01:06:14.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "where everything was attributed to the gods or myth or superstition." : (01:06:18.445)
**Westman, Claire** : "He started to have these more sort of scientific understandings of reality," : (01:06:23.496)
**Westman, Claire** : "of the nature of reality." : (01:06:29.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "And this movement towards a sort of scientific view of the world." : (01:06:33.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then finally, was annex Aminis. He thought a was the single substance." : (01:06:39.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "So where we had failies thought it was water and axaminis thought it was air." : (01:06:45.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "And he thought that constituted all things." : (01:06:50.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he said that the change of one thing into another," : (01:06:53.809)
**Westman, Claire** : "so the change of anything into something else." : (01:06:57.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is simply an indication of a change in the density of a." : (01:07:01.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for example, he thought that a." : (01:07:05.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "When it condensed, it formed clouds and that led to rain." : (01:07:08.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "So a change in the density of air results in water," : (01:07:12.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "and again there are some other examples." : (01:07:16.073)
**Westman, Claire** : "So a lot of these ideas that the Malaysians gave." : (01:07:19.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "Were not fully explained and you know can be quite difficult to grasp because they" : (01:07:27.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "didn't give full explanations, so not exactly clear why he thought it" : (01:07:32.916)
**Westman, Claire** : "was air or how." : (01:07:37.416)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know, air led to everything." : (01:07:38.890)
**Westman, Claire** : "That exists in reality, but that was the sort of 1 unifying" : (01:07:42.250)
**Westman, Claire** : "substance that exists." : (01:07:47.226)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thought was what constituted all things that existed in reality." : (01:07:49.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so for this question you need to have" : (01:07:55.660)
**Westman, Claire** : "sort of an understanding of those of the these three malesions." : (01:07:59.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't need to at this time." : (01:08:05.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "Look at Pomenetis or Heracles." : (01:08:06.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just these three malesions." : (01:08:08.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "But then you need to think about, OK." : (01:08:12.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is it about the kinds of philosoph philosophical thought that the malesians" : (01:08:15.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "had that ties back into metaphysics?" : (01:08:21.995)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's look at this again." : (01:08:26.540)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if we think about the kinds of philosophy that they would take that they" : (01:08:29.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "were engaged in, they were thinking about." : (01:08:33.832)
**Westman, Claire** : "First principles." : (01:08:38.060)
**Westman, Claire** : "So while they think about what is real, what is the fundamental nature of reality?" : (01:08:39.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very importantly, sort of the first causes of things or." : (01:08:46.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "The the governing principles of things. It involved things like." : (01:08:53.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "Epistemology and ontology, which are obviously like what we know and" : (01:08:59.820)
**Westman, Claire** : "how we know. So. So what, what exists in the world." : (01:09:04.542)
**Westman, Claire** : "And how do we know about what exists and also things like cosmology?" : (01:09:09.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you think about how they, for example, an exam thought about how." : (01:09:14.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "Earth fits into the bigger universe, so he thought that Earth fits into this" : (01:09:21.140)
**Westman, Claire** : "bigger universe and Earth grew from this bigger universe and it existed in a" : (01:09:25.412)
**Westman, Claire** : "universe with other worlds." : (01:09:29.683)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's a kind of a cosmology, and they were also trying to think of" : (01:09:31.340)
**Westman, Claire** : "what is outside of objective experience." : (01:09:36.023)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what is it that we can explain?" : (01:09:38.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we explain?" : (01:09:45.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "Reality or what is real or or what we experience and observe." : (01:09:47.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we explain that on a much sort of bigger level?" : (01:09:52.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we explain what is at the core?" : (01:09:57.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "What is fundamental to things that are real," : (01:10:01.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "and obviously a lot of this has changed over time from the Malaysians." : (01:10:04.196)
**Westman, Claire** : "We don't have necessarily the same understandings." : (01:10:08.970)
**Westman, Claire** : "We don't think that." : (01:10:12.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "All of life springs from water." : (01:10:14.020)
**Westman, Claire** : "Necessarily, we also know that not everything is made" : (01:10:16.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "just from air." : (01:10:21.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some of that has changed. We know more about sort of the Earth and" : (01:10:24.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "why it floats and what the earth is comprised of." : (01:10:29.684)
**Westman, Claire** : "Think about these elements of metaphysics and how they tie into what the Malaysians." : (01:10:35.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "Were looking at in their philosophical inquiries. OK, the origin of the world." : (01:10:45.690)
**Westman, Claire** : "What? What is the foundation of reality?" : (01:10:52.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "What? What were the substances that things were" : (01:10:53.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "made of that made things real?" : (01:10:57.414)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for this question you need to 1st think about what is metaphysics." : (01:11:00.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you need to think about. You need to give an explanation of what" : (01:11:05.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "the Malaysians." : (01:11:09.295)
**Westman, Claire** : "Their their ideas." : (01:11:11.890)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then you need to bring that together to say based on these understandings of" : (01:11:12.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "metaphysics and these aspects of malesian thought." : (01:11:18.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is why the MALESIANS could be considered metaphysicians." : (01:11:22.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is why males and philosophical inquiry could be considered metaphysical." : (01:11:26.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so I hope that makes sense." : (01:11:34.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some things again you can think about this might come in later," : (01:11:37.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "but do you agree with any of the malesion philosophers ideas?" : (01:11:41.118)
**Westman, Claire** : "Does it show an important step in the development of philosophical thinking and" : (01:11:46.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "also scientific thinking?" : (01:11:49.776)
**Westman, Claire** : "And what aspects of metaphysics are evidence in malesian inquiries?" : (01:11:51.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK so." : (01:11:57.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's sort of to help you with that question." : (01:12:00.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I know again that it can be quite tricky to understand," : (01:12:03.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "especially because it is very different from our understandings of nature and" : (01:12:08.024)
**Westman, Claire** : "reality now." : (01:12:13.412)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, please use any resources that are" : (01:12:15.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "available to you." : (01:12:19.048)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, I'll show you some sources that are quite" : (01:12:20.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "useful, like some good YouTube videos." : (01:12:23.462)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some." : (01:12:27.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "Websites that give sort of more simplistic or." : (01:12:29.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "More." : (01:12:33.890)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or maybe even more detailed explanations that you can use to help you. OK," : (01:12:34.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "so let me just look at the chat quickly. If you write more than 300 words," : (01:12:38.908)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please remember to make sure that everything you have included is necessary." : (01:12:43.335)
**Westman, Claire** : "Um, you can go a little bit over 300 words," : (01:12:50.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "but if it's too much over then it's likely that you've included too much" : (01:12:53.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "information." : (01:12:59.343)
**Westman, Claire** : "Only focus on the most important information." : (01:13:00.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK so." : (01:13:05.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "For this question says, should we use a meaning that's five or" : (01:13:08.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "ten years recent?" : (01:13:11.294)
**Westman, Claire** : "I assume you mean for the definition for metaphysics, so." : (01:13:13.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "In philosophy, well in most studies." : (01:13:18.850)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, in most studies we would say used" : (01:13:22.970)
**Westman, Claire** : "information that is recent." : (01:13:26.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "However, we must remember that philosophy stems" : (01:13:29.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "back." : (01:13:32.726)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, you know this sort of philosophy we're" : (01:13:33.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "looking at stems back like over 2000 years." : (01:13:36.041)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you're not always going to be using very recent sources." : (01:13:38.850)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will at times be using very old sources." : (01:13:43.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you look up definitions or information," : (01:13:47.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "you can see if there's more recent ones, but it's also not a huge issue in" : (01:13:50.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy if you use older sources." : (01:13:56.313)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. Obviously if it's about things that are" : (01:13:59.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "this is about ancient Greek philosophy." : (01:14:01.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you you would still look for more recent information because new ideas come" : (01:14:03.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "along and new interpretations, but it's not." : (01:14:09.188)
**Westman, Claire** : "100% necessary to use newer sources." : (01:14:13.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you can use older sources as well." : (01:14:16.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you're doing something like about AI ethics," : (01:14:20.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "you obviously want to look at new sources, because AI is changing all of the time." : (01:14:23.390)
**Westman, Claire** : "But when looking at things like ancient Greek philosophy," : (01:14:28.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "if you're looking for definitions of metaphysics," : (01:14:32.155)
**Westman, Claire** : "you might find sources that are from sort of 2000, 2005, whatever. That's fine." : (01:14:35.176)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's not an issue in philosophy, OK?" : (01:14:40.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "There isn't much information about Salis compared to an ex Amanda and Anis." : (01:14:47.250)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's quite interesting 'cause. I actually found quite a lot about daleys." : (01:14:54.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again though, remember, you don't have to go into a whole lot of" : (01:14:58.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "detail." : (01:15:03.344)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's only 300 words, so just make sure that you have the main" : (01:15:03.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "focus that ties into this question." : (01:15:08.285)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you research these." : (01:15:10.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "Malesions, you'll see." : (01:15:13.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a lot of information about other kinds of." : (01:15:13.810)
**Westman, Claire** : "Philosophical inquiry that they did other things that they looked at related to," : (01:15:16.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "for example." : (01:15:22.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "I think there's an ex. Amanda talks about the sun and the moon" : (01:15:25.010)
**Westman, Claire** : "as disks of fire." : (01:15:29.294)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some of that is not necessarily relevant to this discussion or to your" : (01:15:32.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "answer. So remember to focus on for now what is" : (01:15:36.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "most important to helping you answer this question about how the MALESIONS could be" : (01:15:40.003)
**Westman, Claire** : "considered to have been doing." : (01:15:45.314)
**Westman, Claire** : "Metaphysics." : (01:15:48.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "So just try and find information that's most relevant for this purpose, OK." : (01:15:51.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's great that you're doing research and that you're seeing you're finding" : (01:15:57.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "information fantastic." : (01:16:01.783)
**Westman, Claire** : "But remember, when you're writing up your answers to" : (01:16:04.850)
**Westman, Claire** : "make sure that that's what you focus on." : (01:16:07.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anyone have an idea how?" : (01:16:14.260)
**Westman, Claire** : "Especially the bibliography and our study guide." : (01:16:15.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "The bibliography is there as a bibliography for the information that's" : (01:16:17.300)
**Westman, Claire** : "included in the study guide and also for you to." : (01:16:21.922)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can go look use those references to look up." : (01:16:25.111)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you don't need to reference the bibliography from the study guide in your" : (01:16:32.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "work, unless you've used one of those sources." : (01:16:37.786)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you're using the study guide as your source," : (01:16:41.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "you reference the study guide. OK, so I hope that answers your question." : (01:16:44.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "The only time you would need to worry about the references in the bibliography" : (01:16:48.690)
**Westman, Claire** : "is if you used any of those sources that you had found in the bibliography." : (01:16:53.196)
**Westman, Claire** : "I won't get into technical referencing now," : (01:17:00.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "so just focus on if you've used the study guide, reference the study guide." : (01:17:02.875)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's all we want to see." : (01:17:06.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh yeah, that's another very good point, guys." : (01:17:12.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm ladies and gentlemen and everybody." : (01:17:15.170)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm so excited to see how the excellent thoughts that are coming up in this" : (01:17:20.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "discussion or in the chat section and the thoughts that you've been putting into" : (01:17:25.527)
**Westman, Claire** : "these topics, very, very exciting for me and." : (01:17:31.065)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, wonderful to see." : (01:17:36.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "So thank you for you know the thoughts that you've contributed and the ideas" : (01:17:37.290)
**Westman, Claire** : "that you are coming out of here." : (01:17:41.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's quite hypocrit." : (01:17:43.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is the chat. It says favourites." : (01:17:44.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's quite hypocritical because the reason why we now rely on Western" : (01:17:47.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "philosophy is because Westerners thought Africans were incapable of reasoning in a" : (01:17:50.802)
**Westman, Claire** : "critical way." : (01:17:54.942)
**Westman, Claire** : "Meanwhile, their ancestors believed in myths and" : (01:17:55.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "Folklore's, just like early Africans did." : (01:17:58.070)
**Westman, Claire** : "Absolutely, 100%." : (01:18:00.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it is hypocritical and I mean just continue to believe in myth and" : (01:18:05.210)
**Westman, Claire** : "superstition and all of that." : (01:18:11.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just a very, very, very good point." : (01:18:16.040)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I'm very impressed by the ideas that I'm seeing come out in this chat." : (01:18:19.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "So simple, Kazi says." : (01:18:25.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "Did they contribute to the early discovery of science," : (01:18:27.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thais and the others?" : (01:18:30.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yes, so meta physicians did contribute." : (01:18:32.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "And sorry, Tabili replied and said yes. Meta physicians were pioneers of the" : (01:18:37.090)
**Westman, Claire** : "scientific method." : (01:18:41.597)
**Westman, Claire** : "They sought to understand the fundamental nature of reality through reason," : (01:18:42.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "observation and systematic inquiry." : (01:18:46.375)
**Westman, Claire** : "Excellent, great response." : (01:18:48.130)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes. So the the purpose of the discussion, these are to help you to approach this" : (01:18:56.620)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignment." : (01:19:02.193)
**Westman, Claire** : "Specifically, this is some of the content you should" : (01:19:02.940)
**Westman, Claire** : "sort of be considering when you're doing your assignment," : (01:19:06.323)
**Westman, Claire** : "but obviously there to help you understand the units as well." : (01:19:10.024)
**Westman, Claire** : "But more specifically for today, like I mentioned at the outset," : (01:19:15.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "the focus is on helping you with the assignment questions." : (01:19:18.931)
**Westman, Claire** : "Um." : (01:19:23.930)
**Westman, Claire** : "Tabela that is an excellent question." : (01:19:32.710)
**Westman, Claire** : "What role did ancient knowledge systems and esoteric traditions," : (01:19:35.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "including secret societies, play in shaping the emergence of profound" : (01:19:39.222)
**Westman, Claire** : "metaphysical philosophical inquiry?" : (01:19:43.521)
**Westman, Claire** : "In particular, how did figures such as Pythagoras who" : (01:19:45.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "made significant contributions to philosophy and science while also being" : (01:19:48.367)
**Westman, Claire** : "deeply engaged in mysticism, influenced the development of" : (01:19:51.953)
**Westman, Claire** : "intellectual thought during this period?" : (01:19:54.812)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's an excellent question." : (01:19:57.450)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I think one that we won't get into today because of time," : (01:19:59.120)
**Westman, Claire** : "but next week we'll focus on question three of the assessment." : (01:20:03.312)
**Westman, Claire** : "But in the following weeks, we'll look at Unit 1 in more detail." : (01:20:07.572)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I think that is something we can go into in more detail." : (01:20:11.966)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then OK." : (01:20:16.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't want to go too far off the topic just because the focus is for the" : (01:20:17.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "assessment, but that is a fantastic question that we" : (01:20:21.546)
**Westman, Claire** : "will look at more deeply in another." : (01:20:24.532)
**Westman, Claire** : "Session." : (01:20:27.610)
**Westman, Claire** : "So thank you for that." : (01:20:28.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "I will make a note of it so that we can discuss it in another session and it'll" : (01:20:31.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "be interesting to hear what you think as well." : (01:20:35.011)
**Westman, Claire** : "So everybody can sort of think about that question when they are finished their" : (01:20:37.367)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignments and less stressed." : (01:20:41.377)
**Westman, Claire** : "If I use a reference website for my bibliography be highlighted." : (01:20:47.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "Since I use the website now, that's fine to be honest." : (01:20:52.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "The bibliography is not always necessarily included." : (01:20:58.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "When we check plagiarism, because so often the references come up" : (01:21:02.000)
**Westman, Claire** : "as plagiarized, no matter whether you talk them into the" : (01:21:06.185)
**Westman, Claire** : "document yourself or not, and the bibliography because they've been" : (01:21:09.798)
**Westman, Claire** : "referenced elsewhere." : (01:21:14.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:21:15.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you want to use a referencing tool that is absolutely fine." : (01:21:16.190)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just make sure that you're referencing." : (01:21:21.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it's all consistent." : (01:21:23.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "Your if you, if you know how to use the referencing" : (01:21:27.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "tools, you are absolutely welcome to use them." : (01:21:30.004)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just remember we use Harvard, but yeah, you're absolutely welcome to use a" : (01:21:32.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "referencing tool if that is what you want to do." : (01:21:37.111)
**Westman, Claire** : "No issue with that at all." : (01:21:40.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, there was." : (01:21:42.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see two hands, but I think 1 is." : (01:21:46.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "A legacy. Luanda is yours, just up from earlier." : (01:21:49.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or do you have another question?" : (01:21:52.100)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, another hand has suddenly gone down." : (01:21:53.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I assume that was an accidental hand." : (01:21:56.360)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:22:02.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "So here are do you have any questions? OK. I don't want to take much more of your" : (01:22:03.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "time and I do have another class, Nana." : (01:22:10.334)
**Westman, Claire** : "So are there anything?" : (01:22:13.350)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are there any questions that are absolutely pressing right now?" : (01:22:15.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "Just while you're thinking about it, one thing I want to mention is we've been" : (01:22:22.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "getting some emails asking how many points of information need to be included" : (01:22:28.278)
**Westman, Claire** : "in your answer for the 15 marks." : (01:22:33.726)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember, we're not looking for." : (01:22:36.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't have to list 15 points in order to get 15 marks." : (01:22:38.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "What we're looking for is, have you explained the theory?" : (01:22:42.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "Accurately and clearly." : (01:22:47.720)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let's say for question one, have you developed a claim that you've" : (01:22:52.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "been developed an argument to support?" : (01:22:57.007)
**Westman, Claire** : "So have you said yes? No." : (01:22:59.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "Balanced view, whatever and have you supported that" : (01:23:03.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "argument and have you included your in text referencing in a bibliography?" : (01:23:06.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:23:12.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's very difficult in a subject like this to say you need to include this many" : (01:23:12.480)
**Westman, Claire** : "points because everybody will answer the question differently." : (01:23:17.597)
**Westman, Claire** : "Differently, So what we want to see is do have you" : (01:23:21.750)
**Westman, Claire** : "shown an understanding of the content of the theory?" : (01:23:24.536)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then have you developed a clear answer?" : (01:23:28.840)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for example, with the second question, have you made the link between the" : (01:23:31.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "definitions or understandings of metaphysics and the lesions?" : (01:23:36.980)
**Westman, Claire** : "Has that come across clearly?" : (01:23:41.440)
**Westman, Claire** : "So have you explained what metaphysics is?" : (01:23:42.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you explained what the malesions were?" : (01:23:44.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "What kind of philosophical inquiry? They were engaged in?" : (01:23:47.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "And have you then made that link between them?" : (01:23:50.590)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then for the last question is about Plato's theory of forms and virtue." : (01:23:55.360)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, we'll want to see." : (01:24:03.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you explained the theory clearly?" : (01:24:04.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you developed a claim?" : (01:24:08.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you included your referencing?" : (01:24:09.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it clear?" : (01:24:12.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have you shown an understanding?" : (01:24:13.240)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's what we'll be looking for." : (01:24:14.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. And we know at the stage that you know" : (01:24:16.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're you're new to referencing probably." : (01:24:19.402)
**Westman, Claire** : "So do your best with the referencing." : (01:24:23.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "We will be lenient if it's not exactly right." : (01:24:25.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "If we see you've made an effort with the referencing," : (01:24:27.934)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's what we're concerned about, OK?" : (01:24:31.142)
**Westman, Claire** : "Leander is it a hand for now or is it a hand from earlier?" : (01:24:35.840)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Zahan from now." : (01:24:41.370)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh yes." : (01:24:42.990)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So your question might be a little pessimistic," : (01:24:44.480)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "but given that we've taken philosophy now in the first semester," : (01:24:47.216)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "can we then discontinue from second semester or is this a module that we have" : (01:24:50.920)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "to take throughout the year?" : (01:24:55.365)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is only SMS to module." : (01:24:57.610)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (01:25:00.090)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Thank you." : (01:25:00.490)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know." : (01:25:00.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm already losing people." : (01:25:04.470)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, this is a simista module." : (01:25:07.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "Give it a chance." : (01:25:11.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've had somebody else as the e-mail about how to change modules." : (01:25:14.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I know philosophy can be tricky. When you first start. I really do." : (01:25:21.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "But give it a go." : (01:25:26.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "Give it a chance." : (01:25:27.560)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let's see how the semester goes." : (01:25:27.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "And remember this very there's different kinds of philosophies." : (01:25:30.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you can also do this a module in African philosophy." : (01:25:33.544)
**Westman, Claire** : "In first year, as you go on these different modules so" : (01:25:37.310)
**Westman, Claire** : "yeah, but this is mixed to module so you don't" : (01:25:41.213)
**Westman, Claire** : "have to do do it next year next OK." : (01:25:44.547)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are some sources that are quite useful." : (01:25:47.030)
**Westman, Claire** : "And the Stanford Encyclopedia philosophy is always useful, but it can be." : (01:25:51.150)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sometimes the articles are quite complex, but it's a good source." : (01:25:56.830)
**Westman, Claire** : "The incident encyclopedia philosophy, also a very good source." : (01:26:01.760)
**Westman, Claire** : "For this." : (01:26:06.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "I also used Britannica." : (01:26:07.510)
**Westman, Claire** : "And the for information about failures and an ex. Amanda." : (01:26:10.800)
**Westman, Claire** : "The site was really nice. Famous scientist." : (01:26:15.395)
**Westman, Claire** : "It broke down a lot of the work that they did. The studies they did," : (01:26:18.880)
**Westman, Claire** : "and then some videos." : (01:26:23.910)
**Westman, Claire** : "This crash course." : (01:26:27.080)
**Westman, Claire** : "This was crash course history of science, but the crash course philosophy do some" : (01:26:28.160)
**Westman, Claire** : "very nice videos that help to breakdown complex philosophical concepts." : (01:26:32.654)
**Westman, Claire** : "So go look for the that Channel." : (01:26:36.950)
**Westman, Claire** : "This also was an A nice video, metaphysics and philosophy explained." : (01:26:42.280)
**Westman, Claire** : "Here was another one pre socratics part one." : (01:26:46.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry I didn't write down the IT was doctor, somebody, explains. Dr." : (01:26:49.600)
**Westman, Claire** : "Dave explains something like that." : (01:26:54.611)
**Westman, Claire** : "But yeah, so use whatever resources you have" : (01:26:59.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "available to you." : (01:27:02.628)
**Westman, Claire** : "Like I said, you know, go read Wikipedia. Go look at YouTube videos," : (01:27:03.670)
**Westman, Claire** : "use websites that make things less complex because philosophy is complex," : (01:27:09.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "it is challenging." : (01:27:15.857)
