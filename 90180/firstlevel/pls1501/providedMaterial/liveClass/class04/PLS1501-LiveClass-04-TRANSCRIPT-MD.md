**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, I see." : (00:00:04.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "Somebody asked if they can use AI to spell check, but to check your grammar." : (00:00:05.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you shouldn't really need to use AI to check your grammar." : (00:00:13.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can use Grammarly so I'm not sure if you have any of you have heard of" : (00:00:17.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "Grammarly. I'm sure you have." : (00:00:23.315)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've put it there in the chat." : (00:00:25.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is a very useful tool to help you, you can." : (00:00:28.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "Load it onto your computer." : (00:00:33.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or can even be part of your browser and it can help you to check your spelling" : (00:00:37.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "and your grammar." : (00:00:41.916)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, just to be very careful of AI, I'm not going to go over that again." : (00:00:43.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "We discussed it last time." : (00:00:48.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you are not sure about that, just go back and listen to the lesson" : (00:00:52.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "from last week." : (00:00:57.047)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't want to go over things that we've gone over before because I know that you" : (00:00:58.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "need to actually be working on the assignments so you don't want to be" : (00:01:02.523)
**Westman, Claire** : "sitting here hearing things you've heard before." : (00:01:06.384)
**Westman, Claire** : "Again, I'm just going to say please read the" : (00:01:09.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "announcements." : (00:01:12.464)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please read the instructions." : (00:01:14.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm still getting questions about introductions, conclusions, cover pages," : (00:01:15.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "contents pages, how to reference the study guide." : (00:01:21.911)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've put all this information in the announcements." : (00:01:26.013)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's in the instructions, so all of these questions that I'm" : (00:01:30.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "getting over and over and over and over the information is there for you and it's" : (00:01:34.754)
**Westman, Claire** : "making me a bit concerned." : (00:01:40.771)
**Westman, Claire** : "That you're not actually reading through the information that is provided for you," : (00:01:43.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "so please make sure you're doing that so before you are," : (00:01:48.553)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm very happy to answer questions like I've said before, very," : (00:01:52.114)
**Westman, Claire** : "very happy to help you where you need help. But before you ask a quest." : (00:01:56.111)
**Westman, Claire** : "Go look through the materials on the site." : (00:02:01.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "Look at the instructions of the assignment and make sure that those" : (00:02:06.809)
**Westman, Claire** : "questions aren't already answered for you." : (00:02:10.122)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because it takes a lot of time for me to reply to 100 people asking if you need a" : (00:02:12.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "contents page when there is an announcement about a contents page or" : (00:02:17.815)
**Westman, Claire** : "asking if there should be an introduction and conclusion when it is very clearly" : (00:02:22.238)
**Westman, Claire** : "stated in the inst." : (00:02:27.431)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:02:29.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, don't be afraid to ask me anything." : (00:02:29.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "But always just try and see if that information is already out there." : (00:02:35.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:02:44.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I see again some mixed reactions about the assignment." : (00:02:46.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some people said it's going OK." : (00:02:51.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some people saying it seems to think it seems to be fine here." : (00:02:56.249)
**Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole** : "But I." : (00:02:56.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "A bit stressful, especially the word count." : (00:02:59.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know 300 words is not a lot." : (00:03:02.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "But just try to stick to it as much as possible." : (00:03:06.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know it says say that if you're over the word count." : (00:03:12.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "It might not be marked." : (00:03:14.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "We definitely will mark it. Don't worry, you're not going to get zero for going" : (00:03:15.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "over the word count." : (00:03:19.815)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we might reduce some of the marks." : (00:03:22.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you have gone way over the word count, OK, and you know," : (00:03:27.239)
**Ntsako Nkuna** : "Hey." : (00:03:31.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "sometimes we see things like it'll say, for example," : (00:03:31.605)
**Ntsako Nkuna** : "Aye." : (00:03:35.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "if for your next assignment where it's 1000 word, essay or whatever it is." : (00:03:35.461)
**Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole** : "Play." : (00:03:41.539)
**Ntsako Nkuna** : "Yes." : (00:03:41.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some people will submit 10 pages." : (00:03:42.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "And very often it's because they've submitted." : (00:03:45.929)
**Westman, Claire** : "An entirely plagiarized article or something like that." : (00:03:49.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "But if you go way over the word count." : (00:03:53.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know it's difficult when you're excited about it, but you're enjoying it," : (00:03:57.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "thinking about the topic, or you have a lot of ideas." : (00:04:02.583)
**Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole** : "Bye bye." : (00:04:07.339)
**Westman, Claire** : "It can be difficult to stick to the word count and let me tell you I am a person" : (00:04:07.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "who writes a lot." : (00:04:13.217)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm a very wordy person." : (00:04:14.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might have even noticed when I'm talking I, especially in my writing," : (00:04:16.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "that I'm I used a lot of words." : (00:04:21.728)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:04:25.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "I understand how difficult it is to have to condense your writing." : (00:04:26.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's something that I still have to work on even after being in academics for." : (00:04:31.919)
**Nthabiseng Vinoliah  Rammole** : "Setting." : (00:04:32.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "Many, many, many years." : (00:04:38.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it will take time for you to get used to that as well." : (00:04:41.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see somebody said 303 words." : (00:04:46.172)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, I wonder why it's echoing." : (00:04:50.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah. Does anyone have their marks on?" : (00:04:56.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:05:03.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've muted everybody." : (00:05:03.689)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can you hear me now?" : (00:05:04.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. Am I OK now?" : (00:05:11.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:05:14.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "So somebody must have had the mark on." : (00:05:14.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yeah, just please make sure that you turn your" : (00:05:17.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "marks off." : (00:05:19.662)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've muted everybody for now." : (00:05:20.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's just difficult for me to keep an eye on the chat," : (00:05:23.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "on the microphones and all of that." : (00:05:26.455)
**Westman, Claire** : "So everybody, please just be careful of that." : (00:05:28.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:05:33.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yeah, I was saying I rights a lot." : (00:05:33.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's I know how difficult it is to try and condense your writing." : (00:05:35.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then I see somebody said 303 words." : (00:05:40.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "Steps absolutely perfect." : (00:05:43.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "I promise you were not gonna be counting an extra 3 words and penalizing you for" : (00:05:46.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "that. 367 is also still OK." : (00:05:52.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know again." : (00:05:56.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "300 words is so usually when you get a word count you need to be within the area" : (00:05:59.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "of that word count." : (00:06:06.138)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you can't submit something that's 200 words and you can't submit something." : (00:06:07.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's 400 words, because that's much." : (00:06:11.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "Too little and too much if it's around sort of three 5360 ISH 367 is fine." : (00:06:14.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know you're OK again." : (00:06:26.039)
**Westman, Claire** : "Also, if you're like 200 and 72180 words, you're OK if the word count is 300," : (00:06:28.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "so we don't expect you to sit there and work out exactly 300 words." : (00:06:34.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is." : (00:06:40.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is the range you need." : (00:06:43.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "Need to be in OK." : (00:06:44.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "656 years." : (00:06:48.489)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's way over." : (00:06:50.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "Lassander, the university policy is 21 working days" : (00:06:54.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "for your marks." : (00:07:00.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that is what we aim to work on. Remember for this module there are four" : (00:07:02.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "of us who do marking. So some marking might be done." : (00:07:08.804)
**Westman, Claire** : "A bit quicker, so I might you know some some of us might" : (00:07:13.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "get on a bit more quickly than other people depending on what our marking load" : (00:07:17.530)
**Westman, Claire** : "is at the time because you are not out, you know this is not our only module for" : (00:07:22.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "all of us we." : (00:07:27.554)
**Westman, Claire** : "All have other modules as well, so we work." : (00:07:28.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "We try our work on 21 working days to get your marks back to you. So if." : (00:07:31.990)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't get your marks after three weeks." : (00:07:38.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then let us know." : (00:07:42.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "That you haven't received them. If it's within three weeks." : (00:07:44.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:07:49.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "I just said that some of, but I think you might have been typing" : (00:07:50.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "that while I was talking." : (00:07:53.654)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some might get your marks a bit earlier than others." : (00:07:54.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what I'm saying is, if you haven't got your marks after three" : (00:07:57.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "weeks, then let me know if your friend has got" : (00:08:01.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "their Marks and you haven't got yours, then don't panic." : (00:08:03.821)
**Westman, Claire** : "If it's within that time frame, you might have just had a different" : (00:08:07.181)
**Westman, Claire** : "marker or." : (00:08:11.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Mark, Mark this week and then mark some next" : (00:08:13.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "week, whatever it is, OK, so." : (00:08:15.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please don't panic." : (00:08:18.929)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we will only start marking from next week. Even though you submit tomorrow." : (00:08:19.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "But then there's a process where I have to allocate marking to markers so that" : (00:08:27.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "takes a little bit of time as well." : (00:08:32.496)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so I think let's get into the important" : (00:08:36.489)
**Westman, Claire** : "stuff for today. Obviously, if you have questions as we go along," : (00:08:39.477)
**Westman, Claire** : "please post them in the chat." : (00:08:43.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see some of you are assisting me. Thank you very much." : (00:08:46.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "About answering your your peers in the module and also thank you on the WhatsApp" : (00:08:49.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "group, there was a lot of chat last night, so I've not gone through all of that." : (00:08:54.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "But thank you to all of you who are engaging on the WhatsApp group and" : (00:09:01.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "helping each other." : (00:09:05.777)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's very encouraging to see you helping the other people in the module and" : (00:09:06.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "working together and building a little community." : (00:09:11.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of you know, with your peers in the module." : (00:09:15.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:09:19.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "So today we are only looking at question three of the assignment question one and" : (00:09:19.849)
**Westman, Claire** : "two we covered last week." : (00:09:24.907)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you haven't watched last week's session, please go do so." : (00:09:26.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "I saw, I think on the WhatsApp that somebody" : (00:09:30.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "said they weren't quite sure how to answer question one," : (00:09:33.421)
**Westman, Claire** : "and I'm perhaps that's because they didn't watch last week's recording yet or" : (00:09:37.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "didn't attend last week." : (00:09:42.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you are, if you haven't watched last week's" : (00:09:44.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "recording, please go do so." : (00:09:47.585)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then today we're just going to look at question 3OK." : (00:09:51.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we're going to look at question three and then you can ask any of your" : (00:09:55.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "questions." : (00:09:59.884)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Question 3 asks." : (00:10:00.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why did Plato think that virtue depends on knowledge?" : (00:10:05.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do you agree with this view and explain your answer?" : (00:10:09.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "So remember, like I said last week, whenever you have a question," : (00:10:13.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "the first thing you want to do is look at what the question is asking you." : (00:10:17.883)
**Westman, Claire** : "Very carefully." : (00:10:24.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you want to break it down?" : (00:10:25.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "So here we know we're talking about Plato." : (00:10:26.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're talking about virtue and knowledge." : (00:10:29.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then it goes beyond asking you to simply explain." : (00:10:35.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato's ideas around knowledge and virtue, and asks you if you agree or disagree" : (00:10:41.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "with what platea thanks. And in doing so you need to explain your" : (00:10:47.217)
**Westman, Claire** : "answer so you can't just say yes." : (00:10:51.631)
**Westman, Claire** : "I agree." : (00:10:53.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or no, I don't agree." : (00:10:54.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "And leave it at that. You need to explain your answer." : (00:10:55.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "More fully." : (00:11:00.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so I'm just closing something quickly." : (00:11:02.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so always again we spoke about this last" : (00:11:04.489)
**Westman, Claire** : "week, but always when you start your" : (00:11:07.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignments or even when you get your exams or anything like that," : (00:11:09.865)
**Westman, Claire** : "the first thing you must always do before you start answering is breakdown the" : (00:11:14.258)
**Westman, Claire** : "question and try and think about exactly what." : (00:11:19.437)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is asking you and how it's asking you to do that." : (00:11:22.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "So instruction words would for example be that it tells you 300 words." : (00:11:25.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is your word count." : (00:11:31.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "So always look at that." : (00:11:33.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, I see somebody said." : (00:11:36.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "How did it stop recording? Thank you." : (00:11:41.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "It says it's recording." : (00:11:45.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it showing that it's recording on anybody else's?" : (00:11:52.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because I mine is showing the little recording thing." : (00:11:56.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, alright. Yeah. On my side, it looks like it's recording." : (00:12:00.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "Ish. Ramu lephie. Do you have a question you can turn on" : (00:12:06.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "your mic?" : (00:12:09.926)
**Westman, Claire** : "Esra Molefi a question." : (00:12:19.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Your hand is up, OK?" : (00:12:22.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right. OK." : (00:12:23.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you for letting me know. In any case, yeah. Obviously," : (00:12:25.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "if you do notice anything weird, just let me know." : (00:12:28.700)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:12:33.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "So to answer this question again, it's tricky because it's 300 words and" : (00:12:35.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "you could write a lot about Plato." : (00:12:41.648)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you're going to need to focus on the most important information." : (00:12:44.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "And for that reason, we won't go into a lot of detail." : (00:12:49.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "About Plato's theory of the forms, we need to touch on it," : (00:12:55.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "because you need to explain that in order to get to your answer." : (00:12:59.871)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for today's purposes, we're not going to go into the very" : (00:13:05.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "intricate information about the his idea of the form we're going to look at it" : (00:13:10.214)
**Westman, Claire** : "briefly because you only need." : (00:13:16.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "To you will only be able to discuss the theory of the forms briefly in your" : (00:13:18.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "answer. OK, so in order to answer this question," : (00:13:24.418)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're going to need to explain Plato's theory of the forms." : (00:13:28.022)
**Westman, Claire** : "In order to show why he thinks that the form of the good is the highest of the" : (00:13:34.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "forms, and in so doing, that will help you to explain why." : (00:13:42.253)
**Westman, Claire** : "He thinks that virtue depends on knowledge." : (00:13:48.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:13:52.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we've got kind of got three things that you need to do before you Give your" : (00:13:52.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "opinion." : (00:13:58.270)
**Westman, Claire** : "You need to give a brief idea of what the theory of the forms is." : (00:13:59.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Show what?" : (00:14:05.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "Show why, he says the form of the good is or" : (00:14:06.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "explain that he thinks that the form of the good is the most important form." : (00:14:09.486)
**Westman, Claire** : "See, people are not muted again." : (00:14:19.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why he thinks that?" : (00:14:21.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "The form of the good is the highest of all forms." : (00:14:23.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then how the pursuit of the form of the good?" : (00:14:26.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is related to virtue or how? That depends." : (00:14:32.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "Virtue depends on working towards that knowledge." : (00:14:35.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:14:39.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:14:43.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right." : (00:14:43.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there is a lot going on on my screen here." : (00:14:45.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please, if you're not asking about questions" : (00:14:49.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "about." : (00:14:53.401)
**Westman, Claire** : "The actual." : (00:14:55.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "Admin about the actual presentation, can you please just save it because there" : (00:14:58.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "is a lot going on. I'm having to let people in." : (00:15:02.156)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a lot coming up in the chat." : (00:15:04.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:15:08.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if, unless it's important, please don't post it in the chat." : (00:15:08.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so I will say this again." : (00:15:12.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "There are three things you need to focus on." : (00:15:14.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "In order to give an overview of Plato's theory," : (00:15:21.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "you need to 1st we get to that now." : (00:15:25.751)
**Westman, Claire** : "Don't look at that yet." : (00:15:28.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "Otherwise you'll get distracted." : (00:15:29.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "You need to give a brief overview of Plato's idea of the forms." : (00:15:31.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you will need to explain." : (00:15:40.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why? Or you will need to explain that Plato" : (00:15:44.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "thinks the form of the good is the highest form." : (00:15:48.626)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then you will need to show how this relates to virtue." : (00:15:54.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will need to show that the pursuit of knowledge." : (00:16:01.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is dependent." : (00:16:08.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, I'm so distracted by these chats." : (00:16:12.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let me just close it for now." : (00:16:14.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will need to explain." : (00:16:15.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "That virtue depends on the pursuit of knowledge of the form of the good." : (00:16:18.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're going to look at all of this, OK, when you Give your opinion, yes," : (00:16:24.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "you need to back up." : (00:16:29.342)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why you have that opinion, OK?" : (00:16:30.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you need to say why do you agree with this or not?" : (00:16:33.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can think about objections that are raised against." : (00:16:36.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato's theory." : (00:16:39.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you agree with it, why do you agree with it?" : (00:16:43.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "Look for some kind of information to back up your opinion." : (00:16:46.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:16:54.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's begin. The world of the forms, according to Plato." : (00:16:55.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's look at. This is a brief overview of his theory of" : (00:16:59.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "the forms." : (00:17:04.127)
**Westman, Claire** : "So according to Plato, so Plato was a realist." : (00:17:04.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato believed that the world that we experience through our sense perceptions" : (00:17:09.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "or through our five senses, is not real." : (00:17:14.831)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we don't have real knowledge." : (00:17:17.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of the world around us and we will look at that a little bit more as we go along" : (00:17:21.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "through this lesson." : (00:17:26.604)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thinks that the things we experience in this world," : (00:17:28.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "the things we can touch, smells Saints." : (00:17:31.795)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are not real knowledge of those things." : (00:17:35.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I can be looking at my desk and say, OK," : (00:17:37.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know what a disk is by looking at it and Plato would say that's not true." : (00:17:41.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't have real knowledge of a desk just by being able to touch the desk," : (00:17:46.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "smell the desk if I wanted to in front of me." : (00:17:52.320)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that in fact our sensory experiences or our senses can hinder the" : (00:17:55.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "pursuit of knowledge." : (00:18:02.392)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of true real things." : (00:18:05.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because they distract us from using rational judgment or reason." : (00:18:07.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thinks that to really have knowledge of something." : (00:18:13.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "It cannot change." : (00:18:18.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or be susceptible to decay. So he says that the world around us" : (00:18:22.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "changes." : (00:18:26.634)
**Westman, Claire** : "It decays." : (00:18:27.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "So today we might see a plant and think, OK, that is what a plant is." : (00:18:28.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "But then tomorrow, maybe that or in a few days time that" : (00:18:34.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "plant is dead. And so it's changed and it starts to rot" : (00:18:38.565)
**Westman, Claire** : "away so." : (00:18:42.304)
**Westman, Claire** : "He will say that we because of that change in the world around us." : (00:18:43.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "What we perceive, what we experience in the world through" : (00:18:47.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "our senses and through our perceptions, is not true." : (00:18:52.062)
**Westman, Claire** : "Knowledge of the things around us. It's not true knowledge." : (00:18:55.968)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thinks that to have knowledge of something to have true or real knowledge" : (00:19:01.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "of something, it needs to be unchanging, absolute and universal." : (00:19:06.641)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that what we know must be true and all of what we know has to be true." : (00:19:14.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it always has to remain true, despite change and deceptive appearances." : (00:19:21.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he associates knowledge with truth." : (00:19:29.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if something is true, then we can know it." : (00:19:33.039)
**K KAWUTA** : "Hey I I." : (00:19:37.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that we can't have knowledge and it can't be true." : (00:19:38.759)
**K KAWUTA** : "Have a pen?" : (00:19:42.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "That what we experience is the true real knowledge because of change and because" : (00:19:43.989)
**K KAWUTA** : "Hello." : (00:19:48.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "of deceptive appearances, because of the subjectivity." : (00:19:50.230)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of our experiences, OK." : (00:19:55.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you think about if." : (00:19:58.039)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see the color red and you see the color red." : (00:20:02.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "The color red that we both see is not necessarily the same when we see it." : (00:20:06.204)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK so." : (00:20:12.532)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let me give you a different example." : (00:20:13.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "If I eat a piece of chocolate and think that it's delicious," : (00:20:18.919)
**K KAWUTA** : "All right." : (00:20:21.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "you might eat that piece of chocolate from that same slab and you don't like it." : (00:20:22.974)
**K KAWUTA** : "Yes, Sir." : (00:20:25.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "So maybe it's dark chocolate and you don't like dark chocolate." : (00:20:28.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some of these things that we consider to be knowledge. So I might say," : (00:20:33.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know that dark chocolate." : (00:20:37.496)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is delicious." : (00:20:39.469)
**K KAWUTA** : "I am so sorry. No understand." : (00:20:41.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "But to you, because of our subjective experiences," : (00:20:41.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "you would say no, you don't know that dark chocolate is" : (00:20:45.123)
**Westman, Claire** : "delicious because you don't like dark chocolate." : (00:20:48.640)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK so." : (00:20:53.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because of the subjectivity, because of different experiences," : (00:20:56.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "because there's this change and this decay and this deceptive appearances." : (00:21:01.630)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is why Plato says that the things that we experience are not true knowledge." : (00:21:08.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he argues. Or he argued that there is a world or a" : (00:21:14.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "realm in which stable, perfect, unchanging." : (00:21:20.733)
**Westman, Claire** : "Universal objects exist and these." : (00:21:25.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are behind the changing object objects of our scene's experience," : (00:21:33.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "so we're going to look at that a bit more now." : (00:21:36.233)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that there's this realm that exists beyond the human." : (00:21:38.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he says the recording has stopped again." : (00:21:50.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "Umm." : (00:21:54.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:21:57.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm not sure." : (00:21:57.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why it says that?" : (00:22:00.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because it's still showing on mine that it's recording." : (00:22:04.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on today and" : (00:22:10.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm getting very distracted by the chat again." : (00:22:12.898)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can you just give me a thumbs up? If you can see it's recording?" : (00:22:16.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, OK." : (00:22:26.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right." : (00:22:28.929)
**Westman, Claire** : "Still recording on your side, OK." : (00:22:29.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry everyone, I just wanted to stop recording and then" : (00:22:31.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "people miss out. OK, so." : (00:22:35.186)
**Westman, Claire** : "He says this this world of experiences is not true knowledge." : (00:22:38.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "True knowledge exists in this realm that is beyond the human experience and beyond," : (00:22:41.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "beyond the human mind." : (00:22:48.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "And this is the world of the forms, or the realm of the forms." : (00:22:49.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "And in this realm of the forms there are." : (00:22:54.554)
**Westman, Claire** : "These perfect, unchanging universal objects or things" : (00:22:57.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "that exist." : (00:23:04.282)
**Westman, Claire** : "And those what we see in the world are simply." : (00:23:06.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "Reflections or." : (00:23:13.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "Instances of those forms OK." : (00:23:17.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this is maybe a bit confusing, but we're going to look at the forms and" : (00:23:20.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "then we will we'll look at it a bit more." : (00:23:25.058)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that philosophers in particular need to engage in the pursuit" : (00:23:27.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "of this knowledge." : (00:23:32.355)
**Westman, Claire** : "He says everybody should work towards." : (00:23:33.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "Towards attaining knowledge of the forms, however," : (00:23:37.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "he doesn't believe that everybody can work towards knowledge of the forms" : (00:23:41.493)
**Westman, Claire** : "because." : (00:23:47.680)
**Westman, Claire** : "He he doesn't think that everybody is capable of that, OK." : (00:23:50.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that not everyone is able to." : (00:23:57.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "Really engage in the pursuit of knowledge." : (00:24:03.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of real knowledge." : (00:24:06.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because it's some people are distracted by the Saints experiences." : (00:24:08.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some people don't use their reason and their rational mind enough to work" : (00:24:13.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "towards that pursuit of knowledge." : (00:24:18.764)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some people are scared of the pursuits of knowledge." : (00:24:21.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thinks that it's only philosophers or people with philosophical minds that" : (00:24:26.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "can truly engage in trying to attain knowledge." : (00:24:32.055)
**Westman, Claire** : "But that we should all work towards it in any case." : (00:24:36.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:24:41.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "The." : (00:24:43.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "Forms." : (00:24:46.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "So like I said, the forms exist in this realm that Plato" : (00:24:47.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "believes is independent of our experience and it's independent of our mind." : (00:24:52.920)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says the forms have an objective existence." : (00:24:59.549)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the the forms don't depend on our minds or on our experiences." : (00:25:03.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "He believes they exist." : (00:25:09.924)
**Westman, Claire** : "On their own, as separate from our experiences and" : (00:25:13.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "separate from our mind." : (00:25:17.564)
**Westman, Claire** : "However." : (00:25:21.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are not ideas or concepts and This is why he says they're separate from" : (00:25:23.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "almat because if he said if if they were part of our minds," : (00:25:29.400)
**Westman, Claire** : "then they are ideas or concepts that are developed by our minds." : (00:25:33.796)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he says they exist independently of the human mind," : (00:25:38.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "though they don't come from the human mind. They already exist in this realm." : (00:25:42.486)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beyond the mind." : (00:25:48.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beyond the world we experience beyond." : (00:25:50.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our minds, so they are separate from us as humans." : (00:25:56.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "They exist." : (00:26:00.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're independently on their own." : (00:26:01.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "But it is only through the mind and through using rationality and reason," : (00:26:05.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "that we can pursue knowledge of what is real." : (00:26:11.176)
**Westman, Claire** : "And this is what Plato is called a realist." : (00:26:14.643)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because he believed that we had to use reason and rationality and the mind in" : (00:26:18.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "order to discover what is real." : (00:26:25.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might have seen already that for Plato." : (00:26:28.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry for Aristotle. For example he believed in." : (00:26:30.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "He believed that we learned through our Saints experiences." : (00:26:37.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Aristotle believed that we needed to experience things in order to develop" : (00:26:40.706)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge of them." : (00:26:45.266)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for Plato." : (00:26:46.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our sense experiences don't give us real knowledge." : (00:26:48.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "As I've said, it's our mind working in pursuit of" : (00:26:51.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge." : (00:26:56.482)
**Westman, Claire** : "And using reason in order to try and pursue knowledge that we can try and gain" : (00:26:59.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "real knowledge of the forms that exist independent from us." : (00:27:06.554)
**Westman, Claire** : "So knowledge can only be accessed through reason." : (00:27:12.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in order to understand that though, we need to understand that for Plato," : (00:27:16.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "he was a dualist." : (00:27:20.727)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he believed that there was a soul that was separate from the the body." : (00:27:21.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he believed that humans had a body and a brain, but then," : (00:27:29.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "separate from that was a soul that exists independently of and is superior to the" : (00:27:34.902)
**Westman, Claire** : "material body." : (00:27:42.570)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, I see." : (00:27:43.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "I made a." : (00:27:44.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, I see I made a little tarpa there." : (00:27:47.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "Superior to material, the body I wrote." : (00:27:50.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'll fix it." : (00:27:52.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "The soul is independent of and superior to the material body." : (00:27:54.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he and some of you might have this belief as well." : (00:27:58.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "I mean, this is quite a a common belief that" : (00:28:02.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "people believe that you have a soul, that that lives on after." : (00:28:05.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "Your material body dies, for example." : (00:28:11.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's kind of the idea that Plato had that we had this body that could" : (00:28:15.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "experience things, but then beyond that we had a soul." : (00:28:19.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "And he thought that the soul belongs to the world or the realm of the forms." : (00:28:23.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he said that sometimes when we might die and our soul might return to the" : (00:28:28.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "world of the forms." : (00:28:34.124)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that's why when." : (00:28:35.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "We are born and as we go through our lives," : (00:28:40.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "we are able to work towards knowledge of the forms," : (00:28:43.220)
**Westman, Claire** : "because our soul already has some knowledge," : (00:28:46.742)
**Westman, Claire** : "some understanding of the forms." : (00:28:49.791)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it recollects." : (00:28:52.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he's got the idea of recollection." : (00:28:54.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "The soul has already this kind of knowledge, some knowledge of the forms." : (00:28:58.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that is how we can have an idea that the forms exist and how we can work" : (00:29:06.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "towards the knowledge of the forms." : (00:29:12.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he says that when our soul comes back from the world of the forms that" : (00:29:15.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "corrupted by our senses." : (00:29:20.966)
**Westman, Claire** : "Experiences. So it forgets what the forms are exactly." : (00:29:23.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it doesn't have full knowledge of the form of full recollection of the forms." : (00:29:28.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "It has an imperfect or a diminished recollection of the forms," : (00:29:35.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "and that's why then we have to work towards attaining the knowledge of the" : (00:29:40.266)
**Westman, Claire** : "forms again." : (00:29:46.406)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he says again that this is only possible because we have a soul." : (00:29:48.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is independent of our material bodies and he believes that the soul is" : (00:29:53.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "superior to the material body. He places more emphasis on the importance" : (00:29:59.464)
**Westman, Claire** : "of the soul and the mind. As you can see, than he does on a physical world and a" : (00:30:04.877)
**Westman, Claire** : "physical bodies." : (00:30:10.882)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:30:13.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the forms are these objects, these things that exist independently in" : (00:30:14.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "the realm of the world of the forms." : (00:30:20.791)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they are universal. So." : (00:30:24.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "He says that they have." : (00:30:29.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are a general term that applies to a property that is common to many objects." : (00:30:30.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'll give you an example now." : (00:30:36.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in order to know what something is like," : (00:30:40.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "we further we need to have knowledge of the universals that are independent of" : (00:30:43.454)
**Westman, Claire** : "all prior to our sense perceptions of that thing." : (00:30:49.318)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, I'm going to give you an example." : (00:30:53.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then you can think about this again." : (00:30:55.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "The particulars, however, are what we experience." : (00:30:57.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the universals are in the world of the forms." : (00:31:02.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "The particulars are the things that we." : (00:31:07.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "Experience or perceive?" : (00:31:09.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "In our material world." : (00:31:13.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these are specific instances of things and it is not true knowledge because it" : (00:31:14.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "is imperfect and impermanent." : (00:31:22.200)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let me give you an example." : (00:31:25.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're walking along the road and we see a dock. OK," : (00:31:28.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "so we can sense particular things about that dog that makes us believe that it is" : (00:31:32.735)
**Westman, Claire** : "a dog." : (00:31:39.084)
**Westman, Claire** : "We can feel their fur." : (00:31:41.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "We maybe we hear them bark if we put our face close to these," : (00:31:43.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "we can smell their breath." : (00:31:47.526)
**Westman, Claire** : "We think about that." : (00:31:49.809)
**Westman, Claire** : "They have we. Well, we can see that they have 4 legs." : (00:31:51.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "They have a tail, they have ears." : (00:31:54.289)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when we put that information together based on what we know about dogs," : (00:31:57.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "we believe that they." : (00:32:04.422)
**Westman, Claire** : "That that is a dog." : (00:32:07.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:32:09.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we have these idea. We already have this idea of universal" : (00:32:10.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "properties." : (00:32:17.095)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of a doc. OK, so we might say to ourselves," : (00:32:19.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "a dog has fur." : (00:32:23.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "A dog can bark. A dog has four legs. A dog has ears." : (00:32:24.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "A dog has a tail, so we have these general terms." : (00:32:28.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "That say that dogs have food, OK, and then we think it." : (00:32:36.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then there would be a form of dog." : (00:32:42.487)
**Westman, Claire** : "And the dogs that we see that we can sense." : (00:32:47.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are." : (00:32:53.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "Instances." : (00:32:54.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of the universals that would apply to the term doc, OK." : (00:32:58.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "But now remember, he says that this isn't we don't have" : (00:33:02.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "true knowledge of dogness because." : (00:33:07.438)
**Westman, Claire** : "This dog is imperfect and impermanent." : (00:33:11.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "It can change." : (00:33:15.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "So over time, maybe we keep seeing that dog and they're" : (00:33:19.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "changing all the time." : (00:33:22.741)
**Westman, Claire** : "Their fur changes colour." : (00:33:24.039)
**Westman, Claire** : "Maybe they have an accident and they lose a leg." : (00:33:26.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "Their breast might become smellier as they get older." : (00:33:30.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or." : (00:33:35.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "We might see another dog now. We still think that's a dog because it's" : (00:33:36.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "got legs." : (00:33:42.017)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's got a tail, it's got ears, it's got fur." : (00:33:42.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "It conforms to our beliefs about a dog, but it's got a it's got different kind of" : (00:33:45.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "food to the first dog." : (00:33:51.727)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're a different size to the first dog." : (00:33:54.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "Their bark sounds different, so we can't then say that we have" : (00:33:56.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge of dogs." : (00:34:02.208)
**Westman, Claire** : "As a form, because the things that we are perceiving" : (00:34:05.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "and experiencing are changing, they're different." : (00:34:09.463)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there is imperfect." : (00:34:13.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let's say examples or instances of the form of the dog." : (00:34:17.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we believe they are dogs, so that is why Plato says that the things" : (00:34:24.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "we can perceive, our beliefs or opinions, they're not true knowledge." : (00:34:28.954)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we are taking the information that we have." : (00:34:33.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "And applying it to these particular instances or examples and forming beliefs" : (00:34:38.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "or opinions about those things." : (00:34:43.958)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we would need to have. We need to work towards that true" : (00:34:46.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge of the form of the dog, which." : (00:34:51.012)
**Westman, Claire** : "Which would be the perfect, unchanging universal dog." : (00:34:54.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "In order to have true knowledge of dog or of dogness as he might say it." : (00:35:00.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we only have an idea of what a dog is." : (00:35:07.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "Not exactly what not true knowledge of what a dog is." : (00:35:10.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:35:15.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I hope that's making some sense for you." : (00:35:15.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "So just remember the forms are universal." : (00:35:18.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they are forms that correlate to basically everything." : (00:35:23.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:35:29.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "We might say this, the form of a dog." : (00:35:30.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "This the form of a cat." : (00:35:32.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's the form of the table." : (00:35:33.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's the form of a box." : (00:35:35.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's the form of also things that we that are not physical but that we can" : (00:35:37.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "perceive." : (00:35:42.577)
**Westman, Claire** : "So things like form of justice, form of beauty." : (00:35:43.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we might say that we'll look at an example now actually of that." : (00:35:47.032)
**Westman, Claire** : "And in the particulars. Sorry, are the things that we experience," : (00:35:54.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "the examples or instances?" : (00:35:59.197)
**Westman, Claire** : "When we when we say that we have a belief or an opinion or an idea that something." : (00:36:03.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is what we think it is because of the characteristics." : (00:36:12.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of the particular attributes that that thing has." : (00:36:19.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, I might say something like the example" : (00:36:23.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's given in the study guide." : (00:36:25.997)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can look at something and say OK." : (00:36:28.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's square, it's brown." : (00:36:30.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "You could put things inside of it." : (00:36:33.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's got a lid. Sorry." : (00:36:37.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "So then we might say, OK." : (00:36:39.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because of those characteristics and those attributes or those properties of" : (00:36:42.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "that thing we're looking at, we can say it's a box, but they're not." : (00:36:46.983)
**Westman, Claire** : "All boxes are brown." : (00:36:51.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "Maybe not all boxes are square, so we don't have true knowledge of a box" : (00:36:53.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "of box because." : (00:36:59.366)
**Westman, Claire** : "We are seeing examples that are changing and different." : (00:37:02.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "They have these particular attributes or characteristics that we think of as a box." : (00:37:05.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "But they're not that perfect. Universal, unchanging form of box. OK." : (00:37:10.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let's look here at this diagram which I have borrowed from the source at the" : (00:37:17.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "bottom." : (00:37:21.566)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so this gives you a very basic sort of breakdown of." : (00:37:23.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "The Plato's ideas of forms and the physical realm." : (00:37:32.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "You, you'll see." : (00:37:38.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you go and look on Google, if you Google it," : (00:37:39.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "you'll see there's more complex versions of this." : (00:37:42.572)
**Westman, Claire** : "But again, I don't want to go too in depth into this." : (00:37:45.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "We can come back to it because I just want you to be able to get question three" : (00:37:50.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "done." : (00:37:55.462)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that you can." : (00:37:58.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "Your brain hurts, don't worry." : (00:38:01.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm sure a lot of people's brains are but fried right now." : (00:38:03.199)
**Westman, Claire** : "Alejandra, do you have a question before I continue?" : (00:38:06.399)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Yes, ma'am. I just." : (00:38:12.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "Somebody's mark is on hold on." : (00:38:15.909)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Wanted to ask in a way where." : (00:38:16.039)
**Westman, Claire** : "Leanne, I'm just going to mute you and you can" : (00:38:20.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "unmute yourself again." : (00:38:22.244)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, you can unmute yourself again and ask a" : (00:38:23.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "question." : (00:38:26.091)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (00:38:30.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:38:32.199)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So what?" : (00:38:32.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh wait." : (00:38:35.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, I think sorry. Sorry. My sound was off. Sorry." : (00:38:35.709)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So I kind of." : (00:38:35.919)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (00:38:40.269)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So basically what Plato was saying, I'm just trying to see if I understand" : (00:38:43.239)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "this." : (00:38:47.251)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So basically what Plato is saying is that." : (00:38:47.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:38:48.309)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Nothing is true or real because it can take many different forms," : (00:38:52.839)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "so there isn't 1U criteria of something, and because there isn't their fault can't" : (00:38:57.513)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "be real." : (00:39:03.392)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, basically." : (00:39:05.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he's saying that the things that we experience, remember," : (00:39:06.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "we don't all experience things the same. Not everything that we experience." : (00:39:10.362)
**Westman, Claire** : "Will conform 100% to our idea of. Again, let's say with the dog." : (00:39:16.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "We might say that dogs have four legs, but maybe we come across a dog that has" : (00:39:20.955)
**Westman, Claire** : "three legs or two legs or whatever it is." : (00:39:26.251)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because those things." : (00:39:29.159)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because the things we experience are." : (00:39:32.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "Not identical all the time they're changing." : (00:39:35.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "They they are not true." : (00:39:41.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're not true knowledge of those things because." : (00:39:42.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "They are not always the same." : (00:39:47.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're not eternal, they're not universal." : (00:39:48.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so you seem to be on the right track" : (00:39:52.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "there though." : (00:39:54.651)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (00:39:56.989)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Thank you." : (00:39:57.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right, so let's look here." : (00:40:00.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "We see." : (00:40:02.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "We see at the very top is the form of beauty." : (00:40:05.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:40:09.549)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this so if if it helps you to think of it, I do sometimes as well." : (00:40:09.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I sometimes think of the world of the forms as out there in the clouds." : (00:40:15.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "Like you can see it here in this image, this picture." : (00:40:19.828)
**Westman, Claire** : "The form of beauty is out there beyond our world, OK?" : (00:40:24.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's beyond our mind." : (00:40:29.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's beyond our physical world." : (00:40:31.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "It exists in a realm in a world beyond us." : (00:40:33.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that is the form of beauty." : (00:40:39.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that is the perfect, unchanging, eternal." : (00:40:40.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "Universal form of beauty." : (00:40:45.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then we get this." : (00:40:49.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then we get in the next realm is the concept of beauty." : (00:40:51.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "And now for Plato." : (00:40:55.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "These are the higher realms because remember he puts reason and rationality" : (00:40:57.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "above the material world. So in our minds we can think of the idea" : (00:41:02.455)
**Westman, Claire** : "or the concept of beauty." : (00:41:06.922)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you might think to yourself about what?" : (00:41:08.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "In your mind, constitutes beauty." : (00:41:12.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for Plato, that is not the true form of beauty," : (00:41:15.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "because we have different ideas about what is beautiful." : (00:41:20.110)
**Westman, Claire** : "We there are different properties or characteristics that we might have about" : (00:41:25.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "beauty." : (00:41:31.155)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. Then we have individual beautiful" : (00:41:33.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "entities." : (00:41:37.298)
**Westman, Claire** : "So here we can see this is a bit misogynistic, but we've got a woman." : (00:41:38.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "We've got a Vaz, we've got nature." : (00:41:45.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "We've got flowers, so these are individual entities." : (00:41:47.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "Examples." : (00:41:53.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "Individual things that we can experience as beautiful, OK." : (00:41:56.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "And now these are things that we might consider real." : (00:42:00.604)
**Westman, Claire** : "But according to Plato, they are not real. OK." : (00:42:04.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "These are instances of things that." : (00:42:07.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Have attributes of the form of beauty." : (00:42:15.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "But are not beauty itself KK." : (00:42:18.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then below that is imitations of beautiful entities." : (00:42:23.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, in your answer, don't go into too much detail about this," : (00:42:28.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I just want this. I think often gives students a better" : (00:42:33.252)
**Westman, Claire** : "understanding of it." : (00:42:37.517)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that we have actual physical examples or instances of beautiful things." : (00:42:39.339)
**Westman, Claire** : "But then beyond that, we get imitations of them," : (00:42:48.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "which might be photos." : (00:42:51.745)
**Westman, Claire** : "Reflection, shadows, paintings, etc. OK." : (00:42:53.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we have these different levels of, let's say realness," : (00:42:57.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "and but the only true real thing is the actual form of beauty." : (00:43:02.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "I think you'd pronounce it Joaquim." : (00:43:10.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is that correct?" : (00:43:11.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "I see your hand is up." : (00:43:13.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please correct my pronunciation." : (00:43:16.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "Looks like to talking, but I can't hear you." : (00:43:22.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is it just me? OK." : (00:43:30.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, OK." : (00:43:38.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:43:41.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, then yeah, OK." : (00:43:41.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "Perfect. Alright." : (00:43:43.809)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:43:45.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let me again give you an example if that will help you." : (00:43:45.929)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you might let's think of a sunset, we might say, oh," : (00:43:49.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's a beautiful sunset. So now." : (00:43:54.550)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're we are applying." : (00:43:59.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "Um, what we consider attributes or" : (00:44:02.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "characteristics of beauty to our experience of the sun." : (00:44:06.124)
**Westman, Claire** : "It so I look at the sunset." : (00:44:12.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "I say wow, that is a beautiful sunset." : (00:44:13.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "We're looking at particular aspects of it that conform to our ideas of beauty," : (00:44:17.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I might think it's beautiful because it's bright." : (00:44:23.523)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's so many different colors." : (00:44:28.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's orange and yellow and red, so it's really colorful." : (00:44:30.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "So because of these things." : (00:44:35.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "That I think are what makes something." : (00:44:38.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beautiful. Well, that I think makes sunsets beautiful." : (00:44:42.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "I think that's a beautiful sunset, but then night closes in." : (00:44:45.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "It gets later and later as time goes on. As the night progresses," : (00:44:49.712)
**Westman, Claire** : "the colors start to fade away." : (00:44:54.488)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's no more Reds in the sunset." : (00:44:56.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's now just becoming like a dull yellow, and maybe I don't really like yellow so" : (00:44:59.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "much." : (00:45:04.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "The sky becomes dark." : (00:45:05.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we start to lose those things." : (00:45:08.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "That we think make the sunset beautiful, or that I think," : (00:45:11.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "make the sunset beautiful." : (00:45:14.717)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the characteristics or attributes that I associated with it as beautiful have" : (00:45:16.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "changed or disappeared." : (00:45:23.548)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I cannot say that it is true." : (00:45:25.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a true reflection of beauty, or that I know beauty because that sunset" : (00:45:28.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "no longer exists." : (00:45:35.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's gone away." : (00:45:37.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "And also." : (00:45:40.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because those are only my experiences of beauty." : (00:45:41.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "Maybe you don't like sunset." : (00:45:47.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "Maybe you have astigmatism or an eye condition that makes you hated when it's" : (00:45:49.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "bright outside, so you don't like sunsets." : (00:45:55.191)
**Westman, Claire** : "So our perceptions of what is beautiful might be different, but also again," : (00:46:01.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "remember Plato says that if things are, if they change or they decay," : (00:46:07.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "or they fade, they cannot." : (00:46:12.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "Be the real knowledge of that thing. Because of those changes and decay." : (00:46:16.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, Joaquim, I see your hand is back up." : (00:46:25.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. Again, it looks like you're talking, but I can't hear you." : (00:46:37.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. All right." : (00:46:46.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "A Mac issue. Uh. Technology. OK, you can ask." : (00:46:49.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, you can put your question in the chat and" : (00:46:53.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "I will come back to the questions." : (00:46:55.202)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's just and I see there's quite a lot of ideas going on," : (00:46:56.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I'll come back to them." : (00:46:59.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "They just just can't have the chat open, otherwise I'm getting distracted." : (00:47:01.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "Luyanda, do you have another question?" : (00:47:05.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or is it a?" : (00:47:09.549)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Yeah." : (00:47:10.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes." : (00:47:12.819)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So would you have an example of what Plato thought was true knowledge?" : (00:47:13.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, so for Plato, true knowledge is working towards knowing" : (00:47:22.459)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Of something." : (00:47:22.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "the form of that thing." : (00:47:27.506)
**Westman, Claire** : "And now this is where it's tricky because he doesn't really tell us what" : (00:47:29.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "constitutes that thing." : (00:47:36.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if he says that there's dogness, we don't know exactly what constitutes" : (00:47:39.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "the form of the dog." : (00:47:44.924)
**Westman, Claire** : "He says he kind of just expects that we would." : (00:47:47.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "That this dogness exists." : (00:47:52.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "That could it be applied to all dogs and that." : (00:47:55.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "He says that." : (00:48:01.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "Particulars he puts it as particulars. Participate in the form." : (00:48:04.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if something is beautiful, then the those particular instances" : (00:48:09.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "participate in the form of beauty." : (00:48:15.102)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he never really specifies what exactly." : (00:48:18.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "Exactly, beauty. What exactly?" : (00:48:22.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "The form of beauty would be he just says that we have these forms." : (00:48:25.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our soul knows our soul is up there with those forms." : (00:48:30.094)
**Westman, Claire** : "We can work towards knowledge of the forms," : (00:48:34.153)
**Westman, Claire** : "but we he doesn't really give us an idea of what exactly." : (00:48:37.460)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those forms are he just says that there's a form that relates to everything." : (00:48:43.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "But." : (00:48:50.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "It is a bit tricky, so this is kind of one of the one of the" : (00:48:52.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "sort of critiques against Plato." : (00:48:57.135)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK, OK." : (00:49:01.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:49:02.739)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "Thank you." : (00:49:02.849)
**Westman, Claire** : "KJ." : (00:49:04.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, so that is a very that's a basic." : (00:49:06.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "Idea of the Plato sort of hierarchy of knowledge starting with imitations at the" : (00:49:12.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "bottom is the like. Very lowest kind of." : (00:49:19.618)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of." : (00:49:26.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't want to say knowledge because it's not a belief or opinion you can have" : (00:49:27.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "about something." : (00:49:31.645)
**Westman, Claire** : "Then there's the actual things that exist but that are not true knowledge." : (00:49:32.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we have our concepts which are from our mind, which he thinks is." : (00:49:38.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "You know more." : (00:49:44.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "It was superior to material world, but still not great." : (00:49:45.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then we have the forms, the world of the forms. OK." : (00:49:49.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "So." : (00:49:56.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "What so?" : (00:49:56.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "Hi, Todd." : (00:49:58.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's the analogy of the cable, the allegory of The Cave," : (00:49:58.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "and he uses this to kind of explain." : (00:50:03.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "The our pursuit of knowledge." : (00:50:07.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again, you don't necessarily have to go into" : (00:50:10.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "this in detail in your question or in your answer," : (00:50:14.605)
**Westman, Claire** : "but just so that you have this idea, you kind of see what he's talking about." : (00:50:18.778)
**Westman, Claire** : "And let me just tell you, there are so many videos and articles," : (00:50:26.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "but a lot of videos." : (00:50:31.502)
**Westman, Claire** : "Explaining the allegory of The Cave. So if you're not getting all the stuff" : (00:50:34.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "about the forms, remember, and the allegory. Remember," : (00:50:39.316)
**Westman, Claire** : "there are many, many resources available to you," : (00:50:42.759)
**Westman, Claire** : "and the way I explain something might not be the way that you understand it best." : (00:50:45.826)
**Westman, Claire** : "You might find another." : (00:50:50.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "Person explains it in a way that you understand better." : (00:50:52.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "In the videos, obviously there's more motion and there's," : (00:50:56.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "you know, different kinds of ways of explaining." : (00:50:59.761)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you're not getting it, obviously ask me as well if you want to," : (00:51:02.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "but always make sure you also just go look for other resources." : (00:51:07.148)
**Westman, Claire** : "So many." : (00:51:11.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "Many, many, many videos about the allegory of The" : (00:51:12.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "Cave, so you can go watch those as well." : (00:51:15.918)
**Westman, Claire** : "But basically what?" : (00:51:20.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "The allegory of The Cave says." : (00:51:21.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "And again, this is just going to be a very brief" : (00:51:23.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "summary." : (00:51:25.576)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of it is, Plato says, that we must imagine that there are" : (00:51:26.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "people who have been living in a cave, so they've lived in a cave their whole" : (00:51:30.380)
**Westman, Claire** : "life." : (00:51:35.801)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this picture gives you a little bit idea." : (00:51:36.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "These people have lived in a cave for their whole life." : (00:51:38.430)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can see there." : (00:51:43.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, they've lived in The Cave." : (00:51:44.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "And there is ignore that that there's a fire behind them." : (00:51:48.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these people are here, they they chained to a wall." : (00:51:52.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "Inside The Cave." : (00:51:57.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "They have this fire behind them." : (00:51:59.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then there are people walking." : (00:52:02.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "In between them and the fire." : (00:52:05.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they're holding different things. So they're holding different objects." : (00:52:08.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "And so the prisoners that are sitting there facing the back of The Cave," : (00:52:14.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "they will see here, which is particulars. They will see these shadows on the wall." : (00:52:19.923)
**Westman, Claire** : "So these people, the people who walk past carrying these" : (00:52:27.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "things, maybe other animals actually do come in." : (00:52:30.688)
**Westman, Claire** : "They walk in front of the fire and it makes these reflections onto the back of" : (00:52:33.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "the wall." : (00:52:39.330)
**Westman, Claire** : "But now these prisoners have never been outside of The Cave." : (00:52:40.449)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when they see these things and they can't look behind them, they can." : (00:52:45.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's only the wall behind them, so they don't know there are these people" : (00:52:49.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "carrying things." : (00:52:53.303)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the reflections that they see on the wall they think are real." : (00:52:55.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "They think that is real knowledge of the things that are behind them." : (00:53:01.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "But now when we're looking at this, we know, oh, OK." : (00:53:06.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "They're only just seeing these reflections of the objects that are being" : (00:53:09.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "carried by the people, so the fire is illuminating these objects," : (00:53:14.650)
**Westman, Claire** : "causing shadows on the wall of the back of The Cave." : (00:53:19.696)
**Westman, Claire** : "And that's what the prisoners see." : (00:53:24.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "But because that's all the prisoners have experienced," : (00:53:26.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's all the perception they have of the world." : (00:53:30.360)
**Westman, Claire** : "They think that those things are real." : (00:53:33.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we can see that they only have a belief or an opinion." : (00:53:37.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "They don't have real knowledge." : (00:53:41.284)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Plato says that in this allegory that the prisoners managed to get free." : (00:53:44.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "And they realized that they can escape The Cave, so they climb up." : (00:53:51.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "They try and ascend to knowledge, so they try to escape The Cave." : (00:53:56.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "They get out of The Cave and they the world is so bright." : (00:54:01.617)
**Westman, Claire** : "So now they've been stuck in this cave." : (00:54:06.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "Whatever the world is so bright, it's so loud. Umm," : (00:54:08.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "they're seeing actual animals, so they're scared and they become" : (00:54:12.208)
**Westman, Claire** : "overwhelmed in the world outside of The Cave." : (00:54:17.233)
**Westman, Claire** : "But this is what he says we should be doing." : (00:54:21.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "We are." : (00:54:23.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "We should unshackle ourselves from this cave, which is." : (00:54:24.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our material world and our sensory experiences." : (00:54:30.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we should try to ascend out of The Cave towards the realm." : (00:54:33.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of the forms, which is true knowledge." : (00:54:37.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:54:42.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "But if we're thinking of these prisoners, they come out of The Cave." : (00:54:42.479)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some of the prisoners find it too overwhelming." : (00:54:46.678)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they go back into The Cave." : (00:54:49.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "But when they go back into The Cave, the prisoners that were kept there think" : (00:54:53.549)
**Westman, Claire** : "that they are lying because now they've never experienced anything else." : (00:54:58.012)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they think that these prisoners who have been out of The Cave and come back" : (00:55:02.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "and tell them about their experiences, they don't believe that they are telling" : (00:55:07.541)
**Westman, Claire** : "the truth. But in any case, let's say one prisoner makes it out of" : (00:55:12.960)
**Westman, Claire** : "The Cave." : (00:55:17.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "And he doesn't become he or she." : (00:55:18.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "They don't become too overwhelmed." : (00:55:21.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "Films by being out in the world beyond The Cave, then they start to see, oh," : (00:55:23.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "there's a there's a tree." : (00:55:29.337)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's an actual horse." : (00:55:32.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's an, you know, there's water." : (00:55:35.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "So they realize that those things that they were seeing in The Cave were only" : (00:55:37.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "shadows or reflections of these things that exist in the world beyond The Cave." : (00:55:43.338)
**Westman, Claire** : "So Plato is using this as a way for us to." : (00:55:49.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "Think about our minds and our experiences and our and the different levels of" : (00:55:53.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "knowledge and truth." : (00:55:59.772)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that if we get stuck in our bodies, in our experiences," : (00:56:02.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "we can be fooled into thinking that the things that we perceive or experience are" : (00:56:08.585)
**Westman, Claire** : "real. However, once we know once we have this" : (00:56:15.520)
**Westman, Claire** : "understanding that what we experience isn't true." : (00:56:19.410)
**Westman, Claire** : "Through or isn't real knowledge we can work our way up towards gaining knowledge." : (00:56:23.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "We work our way up by using reason and rationality," : (00:56:31.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "and we try and ascend towards the realm of the forms we unburden ourselves." : (00:56:35.762)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of." : (00:56:43.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "Relying on sensory experience, we start to use our reason and" : (00:56:44.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "rationality and prioritise reason and rationality in order to work towards the" : (00:56:49.868)
**Westman, Claire** : "realm of the forms." : (00:56:56.543)
**Westman, Claire** : "And in this realm of the forms, we can see that the." : (00:56:59.639)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sun is it illuminates everything. OK, so in the world," : (00:57:05.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "the sun illuminates everything." : (00:57:10.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "The sun, once the prisoner gets out of The Cave." : (00:57:13.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "The sun illuminates the world now that he's in so because of the light from the" : (00:57:17.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "sun, he's able to experience the trees, the horse, the water, the grass." : (00:57:23.212)
**Westman, Claire** : "He's able to experience the world and we will see now that for Plato," : (00:57:28.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "the Sun is an analogy of the form of the good." : (00:57:35.545)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (00:57:41.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "So try and think of it like that if it helps you. We're shackled here, he says." : (00:57:42.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "In our material world, we experience things." : (00:57:48.548)
**Westman, Claire** : "We have these perceptions that fools us into thinking that these things that we" : (00:57:51.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "can experience and perceive our knowledge." : (00:57:57.860)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he says that's not true knowledge." : (00:58:01.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "Those are reflections or particular objects." : (00:58:03.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that we need to then use reason." : (00:58:06.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "And rationality, we need to try and ascend." : (00:58:10.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "Towards actual knowledge, which is the realm of the forms." : (00:58:13.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we try and come out of The Cave to the realm of the forms." : (00:58:17.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "We try and free ourselves from being burdened by only thinking we know through" : (00:58:22.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "our sensory experience." : (00:58:29.443)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we go from what he says is illusion to truth, OK." : (00:58:31.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "So then that brings us to the form of the good." : (00:58:38.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "So, like the sun in the allegory of The Cave." : (00:58:40.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "If all illuminates the world and allows us to see or experience things in the" : (00:58:44.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "world, the form of the good illuminates all" : (00:58:51.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "other forms." : (00:58:56.101)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for Plato, the form of the good." : (00:58:57.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is the most superior." : (00:59:02.439)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's the highest form of all the forms, so he says in our pursuit of seeking the" : (00:59:03.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "form of the good. That is how we come to." : (00:59:10.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "Attain knowledge of the other forms. So without the form of the good we cannot" : (00:59:13.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "get knowledge of the form of justice, the form of beauty, the form of." : (00:59:18.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "Anything. So we need to we need to pursue knowledge" : (00:59:24.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "of the form of the good in order to gain knowledge and truth of other forms of" : (00:59:28.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "other things in order to gain knowledge we have to try and pursue the form of the" : (00:59:34.870)
**Westman, Claire** : "good." : (00:59:41.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "So our lives are directed to finding knowledge of the highest good." : (00:59:43.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's like a light that guides our souls or our minds." : (00:59:47.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "So like in The Cave, we're trying to get rid of our shackles." : (00:59:54.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "That chain us to the wall and keep us confined to The Cave." : (00:59:57.392)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato thinks that in pursuit of knowledge of the highest good, we are unshackled." : (01:00:02.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or we overcome our mortal or physical limitations and our imperfect sense" : (01:00:07.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "perceptions, which are our opinions or beliefs or" : (01:00:11.770)
**Westman, Claire** : "beliefs." : (01:00:14.588)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we are able to then work towards knowledge." : (01:00:15.879)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he says that in that pursuit of working towards knowledge of the good." : (01:00:21.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "We are able to attain knowledge of justice of all these other things." : (01:00:28.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it does explain this in your study guide." : (01:00:36.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we are able to work towards." : (01:00:38.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "That knowledge of these other things, and it is that pursuit of the good." : (01:00:43.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "That helps us to live a virtuous life. So to live a virtuous life or to find" : (01:00:49.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "virtue." : (01:00:56.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "We must be in pursuit of the knowledge of the good, and for Plato," : (01:00:58.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "virtue is not just the way we behave." : (01:01:03.496)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's not just our external behaviours, it's a state of being and it's the state" : (01:01:06.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "of being in which you are pursuing the knowledge of the form of the good. OK," : (01:01:12.865)
**Westman, Claire** : "so he says if we put our efforts." : (01:01:19.073)
**Westman, Claire** : "Into trying to know the form of the good." : (01:01:22.829)
**Westman, Claire** : "We will then live a life that is just and ethical and we will live in moderation" : (01:01:27.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "and those are attributes that help us to live a virtuous life." : (01:01:34.526)
**Westman, Claire** : "And it is those attributes that help us to work towards knowledge of the good." : (01:01:41.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it's letting go of." : (01:01:46.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our appetites which so I don't want to get into too much, but Plato says." : (01:01:51.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "Our material world or our sense experiences," : (01:01:59.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "they are tied to our appetite." : (01:02:01.893)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he wants us to let go of these material experiences or let go of" : (01:02:03.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "prioritizing material expenses." : (01:02:09.748)
**Westman, Claire** : "Experiences, not expenses and." : (01:02:14.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "Focus more on rationality." : (01:02:18.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "Reason and that involves moderation. Thinking about justice," : (01:02:20.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "thinking about ethical living." : (01:02:26.921)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thinking about courage." : (01:02:31.549)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there's various specific attributes that Plato mentioned," : (01:02:32.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "but using our reason and rationality and working towards knowledge of the good" : (01:02:37.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "allows us to understand or have knowledge of these other attributes that." : (01:02:43.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "Help us to." : (01:02:51.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "Laugh. OK, luyanda." : (01:02:52.339)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "So when we answer the question, are we answering the question from the" : (01:03:01.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes." : (01:03:04.879)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "perspective of the definition of virtue during the Greek times or the modern day" : (01:03:06.979)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "definition?" : (01:03:12.684)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "'Cause I think I'm getting confused as well because the way you're explaining it," : (01:03:13.699)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "you're making it sound like we're answering based off of the modern day" : (01:03:18.516)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "definition of virtue." : (01:03:22.745)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I'm just trying to think here." : (01:03:30.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember, you need to think about what, what Plato would consider a good life." : (01:03:34.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there's things like moderation, courage." : (01:03:40.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "Rationality. So those are things that make a virtuous" : (01:03:44.549)
**Westman, Claire** : "life." : (01:03:47.368)
**Westman, Claire** : "Not necessarily. Things that we might think of as virtue," : (01:03:49.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "as like philanthropy, you know, helping others, that kind of thing." : (01:03:53.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "So when you're answering, you need to type into what Plato would" : (01:03:58.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "consider a virtuous life, OK." : (01:04:03.616)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in the study guide." : (01:04:05.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "This is something I wanted to mention as well." : (01:04:09.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "You need to look also at Plato's ideas of ethics," : (01:04:11.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "which are on pages 82 to around 84, and that gives you a better idea of" : (01:04:16.085)
**Westman, Claire** : "specifically what Plato thinks of morality, virtue, ethics." : (01:04:22.273)
**Westman, Claire** : "6 and so you need to then think about how that ties into." : (01:04:27.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "The form of the good and working towards knowledge of the form of the good." : (01:04:34.789)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (01:04:42.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:04:43.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yeah, so just go look at pages 82 to 84 as well." : (01:04:43.729)
**Westman, Claire** : "And obviously when you're answering because the question is specifically" : (01:04:47.372)
**Westman, Claire** : "about what does Plato, how could we understand?" : (01:04:52.486)
**Westman, Claire** : "Why did virtue depend on knowledge?" : (01:04:59.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "You must go look at what Plato's ideas of morality, ethics, and goodness entail, OK?" : (01:05:03.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "Correct." : (01:05:13.459)
**Luyanda Buhle  Ngubane** : "OK." : (01:05:14.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh, sorry. OK." : (01:05:15.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's what I wanted to cover with you today again." : (01:05:17.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know we're not going into a lot of detail," : (01:05:20.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "but I also know this can be very overwhelming." : (01:05:23.354)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some of you have a good underst or have an understanding of this already." : (01:05:26.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know you have questions that are more specific about the forms," : (01:05:30.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "about ideas of virtue." : (01:05:36.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "So, as Joaquim asked as well." : (01:05:40.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, but I don't want it to become too complex" : (01:05:44.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "at this stage because I know this is very overwhelming for most people at this" : (01:05:49.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "point." : (01:05:57.412)
**Westman, Claire** : "Most students at this point or for a lot of students at this point." : (01:05:58.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you are." : (01:06:03.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you already have an understanding which I can see that some of you do," : (01:06:06.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "then you are able you you can go look at making a more complex argument." : (01:06:10.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for everybody else right now, I just have tried to keep it." : (01:06:16.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sort of to the basic." : (01:06:21.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "Or fundamental sort of ideas that you need." : (01:06:24.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "For this question, OK, so." : (01:06:29.589)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, I'm sorry. We're not getting into more specific" : (01:06:33.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "details for those of you who have some understanding already." : (01:06:37.672)
**Westman, Claire** : "I just know that a lot of people have sort of struggled with the assignment and" : (01:06:43.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "are already feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of their depth." : (01:06:48.331)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I don't wanna ask." : (01:06:52.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't wanna go into too much detail yet." : (01:06:56.389)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know, I said." : (01:06:58.949)
**Westman, Claire** : "We chat about Parmenides soon, but again for this for the last two" : (01:06:59.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "sessions I only want to focus on the three questions for your assignment" : (01:07:04.105)
**Westman, Claire** : "because it's due tomorrow. You don't need to discuss Parmenides in" : (01:07:09.647)
**Westman, Claire** : "your answers for the questions, so we are going to keep that we." : (01:07:14.734)
**Westman, Claire** : "Can look at that next week." : (01:07:19.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "We can go back." : (01:07:22.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "To sort of looking at Unit 1 in more detail and going into that in more detail" : (01:07:25.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "then, OK, so some of the things you might want to" : (01:07:30.826)
**Westman, Claire** : "think about or do you think there is a realm of ideal forms of these?" : (01:07:34.344)
**Westman, Claire** : "This realm of perfect, unchanging universal forms." : (01:07:41.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do you think I'm under separate from my body or do you think we have a soul?" : (01:07:47.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "That is separate from our bodies and this is a very big topic in philosophy." : (01:07:52.789)
**Westman, Claire** : "The idea of dualism, materialism." : (01:07:59.453)
**Westman, Claire** : "So dualism is where you think you've got a soul that's separate from your body." : (01:08:02.309)
**Westman, Claire** : "Materialism says that your soul." : (01:08:06.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is your brain." : (01:08:10.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "That your soul is just." : (01:08:12.269)
**Westman, Claire** : "Well, virtual, they say that your mind is your soul," : (01:08:14.869)
**Westman, Claire** : "but your mind is just a material." : (01:08:16.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "Aspect as well." : (01:08:18.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "So what do you think?" : (01:08:20.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "And we're not gonna get into all of this now because again," : (01:08:22.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "this was supposed to be a short lesson, and we almost had an hour and a half." : (01:08:25.405)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do we need to seek knowledge of the good in order to live virtuously? And here," : (01:08:30.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "what do you think of virtue?" : (01:08:35.695)
**Westman, Claire** : "Might not be exactly what Plato thinks of his virtue." : (01:08:37.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "So go and just check that as well for yourselves." : (01:08:40.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "So do you agree with the idea of the forms or not?" : (01:08:44.189)
**Westman, Claire** : "Out." : (01:08:47.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "And then think about objections to Plato's arguments, OK." : (01:08:48.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there are some in the study guide, but obviously you can go and look for" : (01:08:55.669)
**Westman, Claire** : "more as well in your own research. OK, I'm going to quickly look at some of the" : (01:09:00.658)
**Westman, Claire** : "chat, see if there's anything, any answer straight away." : (01:09:05.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "But I see there's a lot of discuss." : (01:09:09.651)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I don't know if I'll go through all of it." : (01:09:12.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sure. OK." : (01:09:17.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, there's a lot of chat here." : (01:09:19.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yes." : (01:09:21.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK. Sounds like you're saying that we can" : (01:09:27.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "know what a horse is." : (01:09:30.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "Armchair reflection because there's this perfect form of a horse that exists that" : (01:09:32.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "we can recollect from our time. OK." : (01:09:36.636)
**Westman, Claire** : "It doesn't make sense to you." : (01:09:41.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "Perfectly acceptable if it doesn't make sense to you." : (01:09:43.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sold on the idea of." : (01:09:49.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato's ideas either." : (01:09:55.629)
**Westman, Claire** : "If the soul is superior to the material body," : (01:09:58.029)
**Westman, Claire** : "wouldn't that mean that the things that the soul knows or experienced is going to" : (01:10:00.367)
**Westman, Claire** : "make the material body experience deja vu?" : (01:10:04.534)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because, well, that's kind of what you say." : (01:10:06.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "Almost like a deja vu." : (01:10:10.749)
**Westman, Claire** : "And again, this is getting into much more specific" : (01:10:13.989)
**Westman, Claire** : "complex." : (01:10:18.103)
**Westman, Claire** : "Topics I don't want to go there just yet, but things about like a priori knowledge" : (01:10:19.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "and a posteriori knowledge." : (01:10:24.501)
**Westman, Claire** : "So the idea that we have this knowledge already imply kind of implanted in US or" : (01:10:26.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "available to us when we're born or when we come to exist." : (01:10:33.578)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yeah, that's it's a." : (01:10:40.709)
**Westman, Claire** : "It becomes a very complex concept and it's a a very big topic." : (01:10:43.349)
**Westman, Claire** : "In philosophy, especially philosophy of mind," : (01:10:51.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "like how do we?" : (01:10:54.493)
**Westman, Claire** : "How can we have knowledge that is already exists?" : (01:10:55.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "So some philosophers, for example, believe that we don't have knowledge" : (01:11:01.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "exactly, but we have structures." : (01:11:05.834)
**Westman, Claire** : "Into which we can categorize information that already exists when we are born." : (01:11:10.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "So it becomes very tricky, but I'm very excited to see a lot of you" : (01:11:16.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "thinking about these things already and sort of coming up with these questions" : (01:11:20.197)
**Westman, Claire** : "and coming up with these ideas." : (01:11:24.831)
**Westman, Claire** : "If something happens, you get a weird feeling." : (01:11:32.969)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's happened before, OK?" : (01:11:35.580)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, some of these are just replying to others." : (01:11:42.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "My brain hurts, yes." : (01:11:47.819)
**Allison Megan McAllister** : "Lectures. Lectures." : (01:11:49.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "Allison, is that a question or have you put your" : (01:11:57.109)
**Westman, Claire** : "mark on by accident?" : (01:11:59.523)
**Allison Megan McAllister** : "Put it on by accident." : (01:12:03.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, something like the world we see here, smile, etc." : (01:12:04.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is the one that isn't real, yes." : (01:12:09.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, we see here, smell etcetera. Is the one that isn't real because" : (01:12:13.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "there's no perfect and unchanging instance of a particular thing. Yes," : (01:12:17.378)
**Westman, Claire** : "that's it." : (01:12:21.095)
**Westman, Claire** : "Uh." : (01:12:26.149)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, something about Jaden Smith." : (01:12:30.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "I'm enjoying these comics, but yeah, I'm not gonna read out them all out loud." : (01:12:36.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:12:42.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "Some turn to religion." : (01:12:43.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's one comment here that philosophy wasn't in favour of God because it" : (01:12:51.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "believes in reason." : (01:12:55.683)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a whole branch of philosophy related to philosophy of religion," : (01:12:56.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "and for example, later in this module." : (01:13:04.165)
**Westman, Claire** : "You will deal with some of some philosophers arguments for the existence" : (01:13:09.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "of God." : (01:13:14.685)
**Westman, Claire** : "And some of them, some of them use ideas around logic." : (01:13:16.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "And reason in order to argue for God." : (01:13:21.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "So philosophy is certainly not dismissive of religion." : (01:13:25.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "A lot of philosophy actually entails religion or a belief in God." : (01:13:31.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will get. You will get to see that a bit later on." : (01:13:38.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:13:45.339)
**Westman, Claire** : "Proof of the existence of God. Yes, we will look at Aquinas and and some." : (01:13:45.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:13:55.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:13:59.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to get through these." : (01:14:00.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato was very vague, yeah." : (01:14:02.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:14:07.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "I mean, yeah, there's some really interesting things" : (01:14:08.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "here that I'm not going to get into all of these now." : (01:14:12.085)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah. And we will look more specifically at" : (01:14:19.959)
**Westman, Claire** : "interpretations of God and religion and ideas about that when we get to that" : (01:14:22.483)
**Westman, Claire** : "section." : (01:14:26.900)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we're not going to look at that now." : (01:14:27.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes. So somebody says." : (01:14:34.519)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this is quite relevant if the spirit far surpasses the material body." : (01:14:36.279)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's a spiritual world, meaning that there are spirits." : (01:14:40.505)
**Westman, Claire** : "Doesn't that mean this is not the first body my spirit has lived in," : (01:14:43.922)
**Westman, Claire** : "but is another embodiment which will decay," : (01:14:47.917)
**Westman, Claire** : "allowing it to return from where it." : (01:14:50.464)
**Westman, Claire** : "Came and coming back as a different person." : (01:14:52.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "So this is kind of something that Plato says, he says that." : (01:14:54.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "The soul will." : (01:14:59.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "The soul is in the realm of the forms." : (01:15:00.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "But when we die, our soul might return to the forms," : (01:15:04.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "but then it can come back to a body." : (01:15:09.102)
**Westman, Claire** : "So again there we're getting into like a little bit of realm of like reincarnation." : (01:15:12.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "But you can have a look at that." : (01:15:20.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "There is a small discussion about that in the study guide," : (01:15:22.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "so I won't go into it now because we are really over time," : (01:15:25.912)
**Westman, Claire** : "but very interesting point. You can go read that and maybe do some of" : (01:15:29.246)
**Westman, Claire** : "your own research." : (01:15:33.202)
**Westman, Claire** : "Urgency. What do you think about that?" : (01:15:34.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you haven't tapped into something you don't have the raw sensory understanding" : (01:15:41.239)
**Westman, Claire** : "of it." : (01:15:44.556)
**Westman, Claire** : "So how's it any form of sensory experience?" : (01:15:44.799)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:15:52.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, alright. Yeah, let me quickly go through these." : (01:15:56.769)
**Westman, Claire** : "Somebody use computer crashed." : (01:16:04.429)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please e-mail me directly." : (01:16:06.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "A lot of chechia." : (01:16:25.489)
**Westman, Claire** : "Are we allowed to give examples we in supporting our argument?" : (01:16:29.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, if you want to, you absolutely can." : (01:16:31.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:16:36.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right, I don't think." : (01:16:37.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's anything else here I need to attend to specifically?" : (01:16:42.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "Nothing seems." : (01:16:47.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "Oh yes you can." : (01:16:52.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "Under forms, without understanding the allegory of The" : (01:16:53.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "Cave, so the allegory of The Cave is just to" : (01:16:56.483)
**Westman, Claire** : "help you get an idea of." : (01:16:59.285)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's Plato trying to explain." : (01:17:02.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "How he thinks that sort of knowledge works and our pursuit of knowledge works." : (01:17:05.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he provided the allegory of The Cave as a way to try and increase people's" : (01:17:10.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "understanding of how he believes we gain knowledge." : (01:17:17.643)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if you understand the forms without that, that's fine," : (01:17:22.849)
**Westman, Claire** : "but at some point you might be asked to explain a bit about." : (01:17:26.592)
**Westman, Claire** : "What the allegory of The Cave says, or to explain it." : (01:17:33.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "So there's not a huge discussion about it in the study guide." : (01:17:36.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "But just having an understanding of it can make it easier or can make it more" : (01:17:41.659)
**Westman, Claire** : "understandable for some people." : (01:17:45.981)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:17:52.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:18:01.039)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, the about waters H2O. How does Plato count for 9 facts like" : (01:18:01.319)
**Westman, Claire** : "that?" : (01:18:06.704)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because it seems like we have to have a theory of chemistry before we can know" : (01:18:07.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "that." : (01:18:10.881)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we can have a theory of chemistry prior to investigation of the world." : (01:18:11.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yeah, it's it's it gets a bit messy." : (01:18:15.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "And again, we need to remember that." : (01:18:18.919)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato comes from a time in which." : (01:18:22.359)
**Westman, Claire** : "There wasn't." : (01:18:26.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yet." : (01:18:29.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "Scientific discovery as such." : (01:18:31.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "So if we think about how Aristotle was kind of, well," : (01:18:33.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "we had the the Malaysians who sort of started hinting at some scientific sort" : (01:18:38.431)
**Westman, Claire** : "of inquiry. But Plato, Aristotle is considered sort of the most." : (01:18:46.017)
**Westman, Claire** : "Prominent ancient Greek philosopher delving into sort of the scientific" : (01:18:52.529)
**Westman, Claire** : "method and scientific inquiry." : (01:18:58.571)
**Westman, Claire** : "So we need to remember also the time that they came from that there wasn't really." : (01:19:01.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "Such scientific inquiry as yet or scientific thinking as yet," : (01:19:08.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "and again this is some of the the critique of Plato that comes up that," : (01:19:13.447)
**Westman, Claire** : "you know, he kind of just makes these assumptions" : (01:19:18.730)
**Westman, Claire** : "or makes these." : (01:19:22.398)
**Westman, Claire** : "Claims about the forms and knowledge of the forms and these things existing and" : (01:19:24.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "so you can very much argue if you wanted to," : (01:19:31.187)
**Westman, Claire** : "that the idea that things only exist in our minds or for Plato like that," : (01:19:35.001)
**Westman, Claire** : "that knowledge only exists through our minds or beyond our mind." : (01:19:41.271)
**Westman, Claire** : "Is not." : (01:19:47.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "Really." : (01:19:49.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "Rational or plausible?" : (01:19:51.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for, you know, like I said, for you'll see with Aristotle," : (01:19:54.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "he has a different take on it and." : (01:19:58.303)
**Westman, Claire** : "The empiricists believe that we gain knowledge through experience and sense" : (01:20:02.489)
**Westman, Claire** : "experience, and we have to have those perceptions in" : (01:20:06.638)
**Westman, Claire** : "order to develop knowledge so." : (01:20:09.531)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's it's very, you know, again very good points and things that we" : (01:20:12.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "will get into more as we go through this for now." : (01:20:17.509)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember you're going to give an overview of the idea of the forms you want to" : (01:20:20.928)
**Westman, Claire** : "explain that. For Plato, the form of the good was." : (01:20:26.331)
**Westman, Claire** : "The highest good." : (01:20:29.819)
**Westman, Claire** : "At the highest form that illuminated all the other forms in the pursuit of the" : (01:20:31.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "form of the good." : (01:20:36.662)
**Westman, Claire** : "We use our rationality and our reason, which are sort of our higher level." : (01:20:39.179)
**Westman, Claire** : "Human pursuit." : (01:20:48.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's through, you know, focusing on human desires and experience," : (01:20:49.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "sense experience that we sort of can give in to less virtuous things." : (01:20:55.884)
**Westman, Claire** : "So he thinks that if we're using our reason and our rationality and we're" : (01:21:03.209)
**Westman, Claire** : "pursuing knowledge of the good that we can live a virtuous life." : (01:21:08.469)
**Westman, Claire** : "So in that way virtue is dependent on knowledge." : (01:21:13.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because it's the pursuit of knowledge that." : (01:21:16.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "Allows us or gives us the tools to live a virtuous life." : (01:21:20.779)
**Westman, Claire** : "Gives us the the temperament, the characteristics," : (01:21:25.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "the character to live a virtuous life." : (01:21:28.909)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:21:32.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "So that's what you will need to focus on for question 3." : (01:21:32.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember, it's 300 words, so you can't go wild." : (01:21:35.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can't include a whole lot, OK." : (01:21:38.063)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, of course." : (01:21:44.339)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, there's knowledge beyond the material" : (01:21:45.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "world and that's where Plato was working." : (01:21:47.065)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's both knowledge from experience and also in this in the real world," : (01:21:48.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "the place it talks about that does make absolute sense." : (01:21:53.421)
**Westman, Claire** : "But." : (01:21:58.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes, there's a recording of the class, but for Plato he's a realist." : (01:22:01.719)
**Westman, Claire** : "So for him, the sensory experience is not important." : (01:22:05.999)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:22:11.119)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you will see that as we go through the module," : (01:22:11.599)
**Westman, Claire** : "there are other philosophers that say that yes, sensory experience is important." : (01:22:15.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "But we also have knowledge beyond the material world." : (01:22:22.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "Absolutely. OK. So." : (01:22:26.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "That absolutely makes sense." : (01:22:29.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "But he doesn't." : (01:22:31.649)
**Westman, Claire** : "Plato is not a person who thinks that." : (01:22:33.569)
**Westman, Claire** : "We should focus on sensory experience or that that's important." : (01:22:39.019)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember, he wants us to sort of unburden ourselves" : (01:22:42.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "of that and focus on reason and rationality." : (01:22:45.055)
**Westman, Claire** : "So I know things I don't know because of ignorance." : (01:22:49.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "Of what's real." : (01:22:53.249)
**Westman, Claire** : "Basically, and it's also, it's also like you as you study," : (01:22:55.539)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're like, oh, OK." : (01:22:59.661)
**Westman, Claire** : "I know the things that I don't know." : (01:23:01.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because I know that I'm ignorant." : (01:23:05.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you'll you'll you'll start to sort of see that." : (01:23:07.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "So yes, it's it's sort of summed up like that. OK." : (01:23:10.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "I don't want to keep you much any longer. And I also." : (01:23:14.542)
**Westman, Claire** : "Left a." : (01:23:20.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "Symposium for this class. So I need to get back to that as well." : (01:23:21.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "So is there anything absolutely urgent that anyone needs to ask?" : (01:23:26.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "Before tomorrow." : (01:23:34.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK." : (01:23:40.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember, I'm saying this one last time." : (01:23:41.679)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't need to submit a page." : (01:23:44.559)
**Westman, Claire** : "That's an honestly declaration." : (01:23:47.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "There is a little box that you click when you click on assessment one." : (01:23:49.839)
**Westman, Claire** : "A box would come up." : (01:23:54.079)
**Westman, Claire** : "That you click." : (01:23:57.339)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can submit as PDF or word." : (01:23:59.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "You don't need a cover page or a contents page." : (01:24:04.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "You can have them if you want to." : (01:24:07.699)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's good practice to get to do them, but you don't have to." : (01:24:09.609)
**Westman, Claire** : "There is no specific format for the contents page or cover page." : (01:24:13.409)
**Westman, Claire** : "If you want to do them, just come up with your own format." : (01:24:17.581)
**Westman, Claire** : "Remember you submit on the system, so your name and student number is" : (01:24:22.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "already there." : (01:24:27.399)
**Westman, Claire** : "There is no turn it in for this assessment." : (01:24:28.299)
**Westman, Claire** : "Turn it in is only for the second assessment." : (01:24:31.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "Wait, hold on." : (01:24:38.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "Let me just check that before I continue." : (01:24:39.369)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry, I you know I've got." : (01:24:42.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "I've got a few modules." : (01:24:44.169)
**Westman, Claire** : "So let me just 100% check." : (01:24:47.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "But as far as I know, for this one no. So for this assessment," : (01:24:51.099)
**Westman, Claire** : "you're not using turnitin." : (01:24:56.054)
**Westman, Claire** : "So you don't need to worry about tuning in this time." : (01:25:04.069)
**Westman, Claire** : "You there are external plagiarism checkers you can use if you're concerned" : (01:25:08.229)
**Westman, Claire** : "about that." : (01:25:12.938)
**Westman, Claire** : "Sorry." : (01:25:15.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "But for the second assessment, there will be turnitin," : (01:25:17.259)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK and then turnitin is built into the system. So as soon as you submit," : (01:25:20.417)
**Westman, Claire** : "it will well not as soon as you submit and it goes through," : (01:25:24.608)
**Westman, Claire** : "turn it in and then you get your report. It can take somet." : (01:25:28.054)
**Westman, Claire** : "A few minutes it can take a few hours." : (01:25:31.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "To get your report." : (01:25:33.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I think that's the most important things I did send out an announcement" : (01:25:36.579)
**Westman, Claire** : "where I gave you an example of how to reference the study guide." : (01:25:40.201)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please also use tutorial letter 301." : (01:25:43.619)
**Westman, Claire** : "There's somebody's mark on." : (01:25:46.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "Yes." : (01:25:50.739)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, then I'm going to leave it there for" : (01:25:53.049)
**Westman, Claire** : "today." : (01:25:56.050)
**Westman, Claire** : "Because we are almost at 2 hours." : (01:25:57.939)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you everybody for joining." : (01:26:00.859)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you for the discussions and the chats." : (01:26:02.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "I can see you putting thought into this and best of luck with finalising the" : (01:26:06.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignment." : (01:26:11.244)
**Westman, Claire** : "Please do not stress yourselves too much about it." : (01:26:12.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "I mean, I know it's scary to be doing this" : (01:26:16.419)
**Westman, Claire** : "assignment and it's different and." : (01:26:19.457)
**Westman, Claire** : "It's a lot of information." : (01:26:22.979)
**Westman, Claire** : "Ation to take in and it's complex, but please don't like make yourself super" : (01:26:24.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "stressed out or like sick over the assignment, OK?" : (01:26:29.783)
**Westman, Claire** : "You'll be OK all right." : (01:26:36.059)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do you remember?" : (01:26:38.379)
**Westman, Claire** : "We know your first your first semester." : (01:26:38.459)
**Westman, Claire** : "We do take that into consideration. I can see most of you are putting in a" : (01:26:40.499)
**Westman, Claire** : "lot of hard work. So please, please, please don't panic." : (01:26:44.703)
**Westman, Claire** : "Alright, thank you everybody for joining and good" : (01:26:48.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "luck with finalizing the assignment." : (01:26:52.009)
**Westman, Claire** : "And please make sure you submit before the deadline and don't wait until like" : (01:26:54.889)
**Westman, Claire** : "10:50 to submit tomorrow because the system might then give you hassles." : (01:27:00.137)
**Westman, Claire** : "So please submit when you can, today or tomorrow before the deadline." : (01:27:05.089)
**Westman, Claire** : "All right." : (01:27:10.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "And thank you again for attending." : (01:27:10.689)
**Westman, Claire** : "And I will chat to you next week if you have any questions," : (01:27:13.899)
**Westman, Claire** : "please send them to me." : (01:27:18.785)
**Westman, Claire** : "Do not send me questions." : (01:27:21.219)
**Westman, Claire** : "Also 10:50 tomorrow night." : (01:27:23.139)
**Westman, Claire** : "Will not be answering them at that stage, but if you have any questions now or" : (01:27:25.329)
**Westman, Claire** : "early tomorrow, I will try and get back to you as soon as" : (01:27:30.257)
**Westman, Claire** : "I can." : (01:27:33.874)
**Westman, Claire** : "OK, everyone." : (01:27:35.129)
**Westman, Claire** : "Thank you and goodbye." : (01:27:36.169)
