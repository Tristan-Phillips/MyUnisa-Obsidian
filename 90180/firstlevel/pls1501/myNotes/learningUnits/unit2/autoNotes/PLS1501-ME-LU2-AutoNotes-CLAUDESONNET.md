# Psychology of Ancient Philosophy: Pre-Socratics to Aristotle

## Introduction to Philosophical Thought

Philosophy, from the Greek *philein* ("to love") and *sophia* ("wisdom"), literally means "love of wisdom." Far from being the disconnected intellectual pursuit sometimes caricatured in modern times, philosophy represents humanity's fundamental quest to understand reality, knowledge, and ourselves.

The study of ancient philosophy provides essential context for understanding how human thought has evolved over time. Philosophers, while often revolutionary thinkers, were nonetheless constrained by the worldviews of their historical periods, making the contextualization of their ideas crucial for proper understanding.

## Pre-Socratic Philosophy: The Quest for First Principles

### The Milesians and the Search for the *Arche*

The first Western philosophers emerged in Miletus, an Ionian coastal city, in the 6th century BCE. Unlike their mythological predecessors, these thinkers sought explanations based on rational principles rather than divine intervention.

The Milesian philosophers—Thales (c.625-545 BCE), Anaximander (c.611-545 BCE), and Anaximenes (c.585-525 BCE)—were united in their search for the *arche*, the first governing principle that transforms chaos into cosmos.

**Thales** proposed that water was the fundamental substance of all things. His reasoning included observations that:
- Earth appears to float on water
- Spring water gushes from the earth
- Water can transform: evaporation (water to air), condensation (air to water)
- Water takes on fiery appearance in volcanic activity

**Anaximander** criticized Thales, arguing that since water is quantitatively exhaustible, it couldn't be the ultimate *arche*. Instead, he proposed the *apeiron* (the unlimited or indefinite), an eternal, boundless substance containing all elements in an unmixed state. Strikingly, Anaximander hypothesized the existence of multiple worlds arising from and returning to this *apeiron*.

**Anaximenes** proposed that air was the fundamental substance, with all other substances formed through condensation and rarefaction. His theory provided a single natural mechanism to explain all physical change:
- Compressed air becomes cold, then water, then earth and stones
- Rarefied air becomes hot, then fire

This analysis of all physical phenomena as functions of a single quantitative process represents the culmination of Milesian thought.

### Heraclitus and Parmenides: Opposing Views on Change

**Heraclitus** (c.540-470 BCE) rejected the search for underlying unity in favor of eternal flux. His famous saying, "One cannot step into the same river twice," expressed his belief that everything constantly changes. Fire, perpetually renewing itself, symbolized this universal principle of change. 

Heraclitus identified an unchanging principle he called the *logos*, which paradoxically states that everything changes. The *logos* dictates that all things pass into their opposites or are constituted by the tension between opposites.

His disciple **Cratylus** took this theory to its logical extreme, concluding that even language was unstable since both words and their meanings constantly change. This led him to reject verbal communication entirely.

**Parmenides** (c.540-480 BCE) took the opposite position, arguing that change itself is an illusion. His logical argument proceeded:
1. For true change to occur, something must come into being that was not previously
2. But this is impossible because:
   - If it comes from something else, it already existed
   - If it comes from nothing, then "nothing" would need some kind of existence
3. Therefore, Being is one, uncreated, indestructible, and unchanging

For Parmenides, pure reason reveals that Being is identical with itself, cannot be divided, and cannot change. Therefore, all variety, multiplicity, and movement must be mere appearance rather than reality.

## The Sophists: Relativism and Rhetoric

The Sophists were 5th century BCE professional educators who emphasized persuasion rather than knowledge. They shifted philosophical interest from natural phenomena to human conduct and relationships.

The Sophistic position on knowledge was fundamentally relativistic, arguing that there is no objective truth—only subjective opinion. The individual becomes "the measure of all things" in matters of knowledge.

The Sophists pointed to contradictions in earlier philosophical theories to support their skepticism:
- If there is no change (Parmenides), knowledge is impossible because description implies difference
- If everything changes (Heraclitus), knowledge is equally impossible because nothing persists to be known
- If knowledge comes only through the senses, the true nature of things remains elusive

This skeptical stance anticipated aspects of postmodern philosophy, which similarly questions universal truths and objective meaning.

## Socrates: The Quest for Definitions

We know of Socrates (c.470-399 BCE) primarily through Plato's dialogues. Socrates employed a distinctive method of philosophical inquiry characterized by systematic questioning in search of defensible definitions. Key features of the Socratic method include:

1. Seeking essential definitions rather than mere examples
2. Rejecting circular definitions (those containing the term to be defined)
3. Testing proposed definitions through deductive reasoning
4. Identifying contradictions or conflicts with established facts

The Socratic method aims to expose inadequate understanding and stimulate deeper thought through productive frustration. Unlike the Sophists, Socrates believed in objective truth that could be discovered through rigorous examination of concepts.

Socrates connected epistemology (knowledge) with ethics, arguing that knowledge is virtue (*arete*). For the ancient Greeks, *arete* referred to excellence in performing one's function—being good at something. The virtuous person, according to Socrates, was skilled at living well as a human being.

## Plato: The Theory of Forms

Plato (c.427-347 BCE) developed a comprehensive philosophical system to resolve the tension between Heraclitus's flux and Parmenides's permanence. His core theory posits two realms:

1. The material world of sense perception—characterized by change, imperfection, and becoming
2. The immaterial world of Forms (or Ideas)—characterized by permanence, perfection, and being

### Epistemology: Knowledge vs. Opinion

Plato distinguished sharply between:
- **Knowledge**: Certain, permanent, and accessible only through rational intuition
- **Opinion**: Uncertain, changeable, and derived from sense perception

For Plato, the objects of knowledge must be unchanging and universal. Since the material world constantly changes, it can only be the object of opinion, not knowledge. True knowledge pertains to the Forms, which are permanent, perfect archetypes of everything in the material world.

### The Forms (Universals)

The Forms are not mere mental concepts but objective realities existing independently of our minds. Examples include:
- The Form of Beauty (perfect beauty)
- The Form of Justice (perfect justice)
- The Form of Circle (perfect circularity)

Material objects participate in or "imitate" these Forms imperfectly. For instance, no physical circle perfectly embodies the Form of Circle, yet all circles approximate it.

### The Theory of Recollection (Anamnesis)

To explain how humans can access knowledge of the Forms, Plato proposed that learning is actually recollection. His theory includes these elements:

1. The soul existed before birth in the realm of Forms, where it had direct knowledge of them
2. Upon entering a physical body, the soul "forgets" this knowledge
3. Sensory experiences can trigger remembrance of the Forms
4. The "flash of recognition" accompanying new understanding is actually recollection of what the soul once knew

This theory depends on a dualistic view of human nature, with the immortal soul belonging to the world of Forms while temporarily imprisoned in a material body.

### The Allegory of the Cave

In his famous allegory, Plato compares ordinary humans to prisoners in a cave who mistake shadows for reality. The philosopher is like a freed prisoner who ascends to see the real world outside the cave. Initially blinded by the sun (representing the Form of the Good), the philosopher gradually adjusts and gains true knowledge.

Upon returning to the cave, the philosopher appears confused to those who know only shadows, yet possesses genuine wisdom that the others lack.

## Key Conclusions from Plato's Theory

1. Knowledge is permanent and not subject to correction
2. Sense perception cannot provide knowledge, only true belief
3. Forms are eternal and unchanging, making them proper objects of knowledge
4. Forms are apprehended by the mind, not the senses
5. Knowledge depends on the mind's capacity for recollection of the Forms

**Additional Context (Not in Original Text):** 

Plato's theory of Forms has had profound influence on Western thought, particularly through its impact on Christian theology. The Neo-Platonists later developed these ideas further, emphasizing the transcendent Form of the Good as analogous to God. 

The epistemological problems Plato addressed—how we can have certain knowledge in a changing world—remain central to contemporary philosophy. His student Aristotle would later develop an alternative approach focusing on the formal and material aspects of particular things rather than transcendent Forms, setting the stage for scientific empiricism.

These ancient philosophical debates about knowledge, reality, and human nature are not merely historical artifacts but continue to shape how we understand the psychological dimensions of human cognition, perception, and reasoning.

## Platonic Epistemology

### Knowledge, Truth, and Belief in Plato's Philosophy

#### Core Epistemological Claims
- Knowledge must be *true* - one cannot know what is false
- Mental states can only be considered "knowing" to the extent they participate in truth
- Truth consists in the degree to which particular things conform to their archetypes in the realm of Forms
- Knowledge fundamentally involves perceiving this conformity between particulars and Forms

#### Knowledge vs. Belief
- Modern thinkers often contrast knowledge with belief
- For Plato, knowledge is an individual intellectual state or act of recognizing truth
- Knowledge is entirely "inside the head" - material world contains only the contingent, deceptive appearances of knowledge
- True knowledge comes from reason, not sensory experience

#### Theory of Forms
- Forms exist as perfect, immutable archetypes of all things
- Particular objects in the material world participate in these Forms
- Forms are more real than their material instances
- Knowledge involves recognizing the Forms through rational contemplation

### Criticisms of Plato's Theory of Knowledge

1. **The Relationship Problem**: How are Forms related to one another and to the particular things that exemplify them?

2. **The Participation Problem**: How exactly do material things "participate" in Forms?

3. **The Third Man Argument** (Aristotle's criticism): 
   - If the Form of Man is what all men resemble, is it just another man?
   - If not, how can men resemble it?
   - This creates an infinite regress: If a man resembles the Form of Man, we need another Form to explain the resemblance, and so on

4. **The Problem of Relational Terms**:
   - Terms like "tall," "short," etc. have no absolute meaning
   - They require comparison to have meaning
   - There can't be a Form of "tallness" since the same object would be both "tall" and "short" depending on comparison

5. **The Problem of Universals**:
   - Plato's realist approach treats classes as objects of knowledge independent of particulars
   - This creates difficulty explaining how both universals and particulars can be legitimate objects of knowledge

## Aristotelian Epistemology

### Aristotle's Theory of Knowledge

#### Fundamental Principles
1. We perceive the world through our senses, recognizing that perceptions are partial representations of reality
2. Reason must be used to discover the unchanging essence of what we perceive
3. Knowledge is organized hierarchically:
   - Contingent knowledge (undifferentiated and changing)
   - Universal knowledge or genus (qualities shared by groups)
   - Essential knowledge or species (unique specific qualities)
4. Essential properties can be discovered through the four causes

#### Differences from Plato
- Forms and particulars are interdependent; neither can exist without the other
- Knowledge is not innate or recollected but acquired with the help of sense perception
- Sense perception plays an essential role: "the act of sense perception is of the particular but its content is Universal"

#### Hierarchy of Forms
- Forms exist in a classification scheme where each has a defined place
- Species are contained within genera
- Species are distinguished by unique, essential characteristics
- Knowledge is only possible of Forms, not of particulars, because particulars cannot be defined

#### Process of Knowledge Acquisition
1. **Induction**: Generalizing from observation of particulars
2. **Establishing causal connections**: Converting plain facts to reasoned facts
3. **Nous** (intuition): A superior form of apprehension that reveals causes directly
4. **Deduction**: Further scientific knowledge reached through logical deduction

### Summary of Aristotle's Epistemology
1. Aristotle was a realist who believed Forms have objective existence
2. Forms cannot exist independently of particulars - they are interdependent
3. Knowledge is gained with help from sense perception, not recollection
4. Forms possess necessary attributes that define them
5. Intuition (nous) reveals causes and reasoned facts
6. Scientific knowledge is based on reasoned facts and extended through deduction
7. Empirical inquiry can yield knowledge as certain as mathematical knowledge

### Truth, Belief, and Justification
- Aristotle accepted that knowledge connects to truth, belief, and justification
- Truth is "to say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not"
- Justification requires extensive observation and careful investigation

## The Four Causes (Aristotelian Metaphysics)

### Types of Causes
1. **Material Cause**: The stuff of which something is composed
   - Example for tire: rubber with chemical additives, steel wire reinforcing, steel rim

2. **Formal Cause**: The shape, pattern, composition, or structure
   - Example for tire: circular pattern, about 20cm deep, with textured surface

3. **Efficient/Motive Cause**: The initiator of the process that brings something into being
   - Example for tire: produced by melting and molding rubber

4. **Final Cause**: The goal or end for which something occurs
   - Example for tire: aimed at producing a safe, smooth car/road interface

### Metaphysical Implications

#### Knowledge as Accessible
- Knowledge is ordinary and accessible to all who observe the world carefully
- Not a mystical communion restricted to exceptional individuals (contra Plato)

#### Limits of Knowledge
- Everything is knowable except things that happen by accident (not determined by causal laws)
- Chance events are not knowable because they don't follow causal laws

#### Metaphysical Framework
- Ordinary physical objects like tables and cats are the objects of knowledge
- No hierarchy of being with Forms at the top (unlike Plato)
- Form and matter never exist separately

#### Potentiality and Actuality
- Matter is potentiality; form is actualized matter
- All things are involved in processes of change
- Each thing possesses power to develop toward its "end" (entelechy)
- Self-contained end of anything is its entelechy

### The Unmoved Mover
- Not the first mover or creator in theological sense
- The "reason for" or "principle of" motion
- Acts as final cause and thereby as efficient cause through attraction
- Makes the world an intelligible order by inspiring striving toward natural ends

## Critical Observations

1. We can question whether reason is an infallible guide to causes of events

2. Different kinds of knowledge might be justified in different ways:
   - Mathematical knowledge (deductive)
   - Empirical knowledge (observational)

3. Classification systems are useful scientific tools but may involve contingent associations rather than necessary ones

4. Modern scientists side with Hume against Aristotle on whether scientific laws embody logically necessary truths

## Summary Comparison of Plato and Aristotle

|Aspect|Plato|Aristotle|
|------|-----|---------|
|Source of Knowledge|Recollection of Forms|Sense perception + reason|
|Forms and Particulars|Forms independent of particulars|Forms and particulars interdependent|
|Location of Reality|In the realm of Forms|In physical objects (substances)|
|Accessibility of Knowledge|Limited to philosophical elites|Available to all careful observers|
|Essence of Knowledge|Mystical communion with Forms|Understanding causal relationships|
|Role of Senses|Distractions from true knowledge|Essential first step toward knowledge|
|Nature of Truth|Conformity to Forms|Saying what is, is; what is not, is not|

**(Additional context: Both philosophers conceived knowledge as involving necessary relations between events, and both believed proper methods could lead to certain knowledge. This contrasts with later epistemological developments, especially after Hume's critiques of causality and necessary connections.)**

## Introduction to Philosophical Thinking in Ancient Greece

Philosophy, derived from Greek *philein* ("to love") and *sophia* ("wisdom"), literally means "love of wisdom." While contemporary philosophy has evolved significantly from its ancient origins, understanding the historical development of philosophical thought is essential for comprehending modern philosophical concepts and methods.

### The Nature of Philosophy

Philosophy is fundamentally a rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about existence—the what, how, and why of reality. Unlike the stereotypical image of philosophy as a detached intellectual pursuit, true philosophical inquiry emerges from everyday experiences and questions about reality. Key characteristics of philosophical inquiry include:

- Continuous debate and self-criticism
- Development through dialogue and discussion
- Provisional definition of concepts followed by critical examination
- Advancement through disagreement and refinement of ideas

Philosophy doesn't simply provide answers; it develops methods to question assumptions, examine implications, and create coherent frameworks for understanding reality.

## Mythological Thought vs. Philosophical Thought

### Characteristics of Mythological Thought
- Mind is dominated by sense impressions
- Anthropomorphic interpretation of natural phenomena
- Uncritical acceptance of sensory testimony
- Attempt to establish cosmic order through mythical narratives

### The Transition to Philosophy
The first philosophers emerged when thinking shifted from mythological explanations to rational inquiry. This shift was characterized by:

- Critical examination of sense impressions
- Search for consistent explanations of phenomena
- Rejection of anthropomorphic interpretations of nature
- Development of logical reasoning as methodology

This transition occurred in the 6th century BCE, particularly in Miletus (Ionian coast), driven partly by economic and material needs as Greek society shifted from agricultural to maritime lifestyles.

## Pre-Socratic Philosophy: The Search for the Arche

The Pre-Socratics were preoccupied with identifying the first governing principle of the world—the *arche*—that transforms chaos into cosmos. They challenged the prevailing mythological view of four basic elements (Air, Earth, Fire, Water), seeking instead a single fundamental element or principle.

### The Milesian School

#### Thales (c. 625-545 BCE)
- Proposed Water as the fundamental element
- Reasoning included: earth appears to rest on water; water can transform into other elements; all living things require moisture
- First to seek naturalistic rather than mythological explanations

#### Anaximander (c. 611-545 BCE)
- Criticized Thales' view that water was the *arche*
- Proposed the *apeiron* (the unlimited/indefinite) as the *arche*
- Claimed there are unlimited numbers of worlds arising from and returning to the *apeiron*
- Objected that water is quantitatively exhaustible and thus cannot be the fundamental principle

#### Anaximenes (c. 585-525 BCE)
- Proposed Air as the fundamental element
- Introduced the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction to explain transformations
- When compressed, air becomes water and eventually earth/stones; when rarefied, it becomes fire
- Created a unified explanatory system of physical change through a single mechanism

### Other Significant Pre-Socratics

#### Heraclitus (c. 540-470 BCE)
- Rejected the search for an underlying unity
- Claimed everything is in constant flux: "One cannot step into the same river twice"
- Identified Fire as symbolic of perpetual change
- Introduced the concept of *logos*—the universal principle that everything changes
- Proposed unity of opposites in constant tension

His disciple Cratylus took this to the extreme, concluding that:
- If everything constantly changes, even words and their meanings change
- Communication becomes impossible
- We cannot step into the same river even once
- Knowledge is impossible if objects constantly change

#### Parmenides (c. 540-480 BCE)
- Opposed Heraclitus by claiming change is an illusion
- Argued change is logically impossible:
  * If something comes into being, it must come either from something or nothing
  * If from something, it already existed; if from nothing, that's impossible
  * Therefore, change is illusory
- Concluded that being is one, uncreated, indestructible, and unchanging
- Established "The Way of Truth" through pure logical reasoning
- Used strict logical analysis to show contradictions in everyday language about change

### The Sophists
The Sophists were 5th century BCE professional educators who shifted philosophical focus from natural philosophy to human conduct and relationships:

- Emphasized persuasion rather than knowledge
- Argued that philosophy revealed no consensus among philosophers
- Concluded there is no objective truth—only subjective opinion
- Adopted philosophical relativism and skepticism
- Compared by Bertrand Russell to modern corporate lawyers

## Socrates (c. 470-399 BCE)

Our understanding of Socrates comes primarily through Plato's dialogues, where Socrates appears as the main character. Socrates developed a distinctive method of philosophical inquiry:

### The Socratic Method
- Systematic questioning aimed at finding precise definitions of concepts
- Search for the essential nature of things rather than examples
- Examination of provisional definitions through logical analysis
- Rejection of circular reasoning and inadequate definitions
- Testing of definitions through deduction to reveal contradictions

This method aims to reveal the limitations in our understanding and move toward more precise definitions through:
1. Starting with provisional definitions based on common understanding
2. Testing these definitions for logical consistency
3. Identifying contradictions or counter-examples
4. Refining definitions based on these insights

Socrates claimed to "know that he did not know" (Socratic ignorance), distinguishing his approach from the Sophists' skepticism by seeking clarification rather than merely demonstrating argumentative skill.

## Plato (c. 428-348 BCE)

Plato attempted to resolve the impasse between Parmenides' unchanging reality and Heraclitus' constant flux by proposing a dual-realm theory of reality.

### Theory of Forms (Ideas)

#### Key Principles:
1. The physical world we perceive through senses is constantly changing and therefore not fully real
2. True knowledge requires unchanging objects of knowledge
3. These unchanging objects are Forms (or Ideas)—perfect, eternal patterns that exist independently of physical objects
4. Physical objects participate in or imitate Forms, but never perfectly embody them
5. Forms exist in their own realm, separate from the physical world

#### Characteristics of Forms:
- Eternal and unchanging
- Perfect exemplars of qualities (e.g., perfect Beauty, Justice, Circle)
- Not accessible through sense perception but through rational intuition
- Hierarchically arranged with the Form of the Good at the summit
- More real than physical objects, which are mere shadows of Forms

### Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology)

#### Knowledge vs. Opinion:
- Knowledge (*episteme*) is of what is real and unchanging (Forms)
- Opinion (*doxa*) is of the changing physical world
- Knowledge is certain; opinion is provisional and subject to error

#### Recollection (Anamnesis):
- The soul existed before birth in the realm of Forms
- Learning is recollection of knowledge the soul possessed before birth
- Sensory encounters with imperfect physical objects can trigger recollection of Forms
- True knowledge requires overcoming bodily distractions through philosophical training

#### The Divided Line (Levels of Knowledge):
1. Illusion (*eikasia*) - shadows, reflections
2. Belief (*pistis*) - physical objects
3. Thought (*dianoia*) - mathematical reasoning
4. Understanding (*noesis*) - direct apprehension of Forms

### Metaphysical Dualism
Plato established a fundamental dualism between:
- Body (physical, changing, mortal) and Soul (immaterial, unchanging, immortal)
- Appearance (physical world) and Reality (world of Forms)
- Opinion and Knowledge

### Criticisms of Plato's Theory:
- The "Third Man Argument" - If the Form of Man is what all men resemble, is it just another man? If so, we need another Form to explain this relation, leading to infinite regress.
- The problem of participation - How exactly do physical objects "participate in" Forms?
- The problem of relational qualities - Can there be Forms of relational terms like "tall" or "small" which have meaning only in comparison?

## Aristotle (384-322 BCE)

Aristotle, Plato's student, developed a more empirically-grounded philosophy while maintaining many of his teacher's concerns.

### Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology)

#### Key Differences from Plato:
- Forms do not exist independently of particulars; they are interdependent
- Knowledge is not innate recollection but developed through observation and reasoning
- Sense perception plays an essential role in acquiring knowledge
- Classification and categorization are central to knowledge acquisition

#### Classification of Knowledge:
- Species (lowest level) - defined by essential properties
- Genus (higher level) - containing multiple species
- Knowledge is of universals (Forms), not particulars
- Particulars can be described and identified but not defined

#### From Plain Facts to Reasoned Facts:
1. Observation provides "plain facts" (properties that regularly appear together)
2. Induction enables generalization from particulars to universals
3. Causal connections establish necessity and reveal "reasoned facts"
4. Intuition (*nous*) allows direct apprehension of causes and principles

### The Four Causes

Aristotle identified four different kinds of causes that explain why things are as they are:

1. **Material Cause**: The matter from which something is made
   - Example: The bronze of a statue

2. **Formal Cause**: The pattern, shape, or structure that gives something its form
   - Example: The shape of the statue

3. **Efficient Cause**: The agent that brings something into being
   - Example: The sculptor who made the statue

4. **Final Cause**: The purpose or goal for which something exists
   - Example: The purpose for which the statue was created

### Metaphysics

#### Substance Theory:
- Individual substances are the primary realities
- Each substance is a combination of matter and form
- Matter is potentiality; form is actuality
- Change occurs when potentiality becomes actuality

#### Potentiality and Actuality:
- Things have inherent potential to become what their form determines
- Each thing strives toward its natural end (*telos*)
- The self-contained end of anything is its *entelechy*
- Movement/change is the actualization of potential

#### The Unmoved Mover:
- The eternal principle of motion and order in the universe
- Pure actuality with no potentiality
- Causes motion as an object of desire/final cause rather than efficient cause
- Makes the world an intelligible order through the power of attraction

### Criticisms of Aristotle's Theory:
- Assumption that reason is an infallible guide to causes
- Belief that scientific laws embody logically necessary truth
- Classification schemes may reflect convenience rather than necessity
- Modern science rejects the notion that physical causes create logically necessary connections

## Comparing Plato and Aristotle

| Aspect | Plato | Aristotle |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Reality | Forms are more real than particulars | Individual substances are primary realities |
| Forms | Exist independently of particulars | Cannot exist apart from particulars |
| Knowledge | Recollection of innate ideas | Derived from sense perception and reason |
| Method | Dialectic reasoning | Observation, classification, causal analysis |
| Truth | Correspondence to eternal Forms | Stating "what is" as it is |
| Soul | Completely separable from body | Form of the body, not fully separable |
| Ethics | Based on knowledge of the Form of Good | Based on fulfilling natural function |

## Significance for Modern Philosophy

The debates between these ancient philosophers established fundamental questions that continue to shape philosophical inquiry:

- The relationship between appearance and reality
- The possibility and nature of objective knowledge
- The role of reason versus sense experience
- The status of universals (Forms/categories)
- The nature of causality
- The relationship between knowledge and ethics

***

*Note added for context: While not explicitly discussed in the original text, it's important to recognize that the Pre-Socratics' search for natural explanations marked a crucial shift from mythological thinking to rational inquiry that forms the basis of modern scientific thought. Their questioning of fundamental principles established the pattern for systematic philosophical inquiry that continues today.*
