1652 -> The year in which the indigenous people (of South Africa) began their multi-century war of liberation against their European conquerors [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3483R|p.12]]

>The dominant conception of non-racialism which appears to prevail in South Africa is akin to what philosopher of race Theo David Goldberg has called anti-racialism which is to be distinguished from anti-racism 
>> (Goldberg, 2006: 257) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3486R|p.12]]

>Anti-racialism has its ideal effect in critical terms as the prevalence of a racism without races [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3489R|p.12]]

>In such a situation the categories of race which were used to systematically oppress the indigenous people conquered in the unjust wars of colonization and differentiate them from the conqueror are required to fall away [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&selection=160,60,173,4&color=note|p.12]]

>The falling away of the categories of race neither subtracts the unjustly gained privilege and power of the beneficiaries of racism nor does it restore freedom, justice, dignity and equality to the victims of racism. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3492R|p.12]]

>The effect of this approach is ultimately to leave the consequences of a history of injustice undisturbed. This conception of non-racialism very often has left the historical victims of racism without recourse to justice. They are instead under its rule themselves accused of being racist in their pursuit of social justice. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3495R|p.12]]

 >it originates from the English-speaking settler populations and their philosophical tradition of Cape Liberalism [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3498R|p.12]]

>Much like its more explicitly racist conservative counterpart Afrikaner Nationalism which can be traced to the Dutch settlers who began their wars of the conquest of South Africa in 1652, it also has its basis upon an unquestioned ethically questionable “right of conquest” which has its origin in Western philosophy (Day, 2008, pp. 92-111) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=12&annotation=3501R|p.12]]

# The Study of Racism and Philosophy in South Africa
 >A rise in the prominence of what is commonly called the Critical Philosophy of race has to some extent succeeded in making the point that racism is a philosophically relevant subject and has <u>implications for philosophy in at least two main ways</u> which are interrelated.  [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3504R|p.13]]

 - **The first** is that (Western) philosophy has itself been complicit and continues to be either explicitly or tacitly involved, in the construction of the theoretical edifice of racism and racist thinking. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3507R|p.13]]
 - The second way is that even in those places where philosophy has not itself been directly responsible, it nevertheless is competent and able to assist. Where philosophy is unable to assist in the solution of problems of race, it can certainly assist us in the gaining of a better understanding about the origins of the problems, their nature and workings. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3510R|p.13]]

>Thus there is no provision for philosophy to be a passive spectator in the discourses on racism and the practical implications thereof. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3513R|p.13]]

>Charles Mills (1998) has suggested that part of the reason for this is “the self-sustaining dynamic of the ‘whiteness’ of philosophy, not the uncontroversial whiteness of most of its practitioners but what could be called, more contestably, the conceptual or theoretical whiteness of the discipline.”(Mills, 1998: 2) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3516R|p.13]]

>He suggests that this theoretical “whiteness” has by itself been enough to discourage black post-graduate students considering a career in the academy which in turn causes certain traits to go either wholly or very weakly challenged so as to maintain the “consistently monochromatic” character of the discipline (Mills, 1998: 2). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=13&annotation=3519R|p.13]]

>Much of this has got to do with the general under-representation of the historical victims of racism from academic philosophy in South Africa as well as the continued commitment to ignorance of African philosophy [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3522R|p.14]]

# Racism, the Eurocentric university and the marginality of African Philosophy in South Africa
#### Introduction
>The school and university as they currently exist in South Africa were founded by the European settler. Initially the school was to serve the settler’s immediate personal interest fulfilling the wish to remain intimately connected to ‘the metropolis’ or “source” (of civilization and culture). Thus the curriculum and approach to teaching were as consistent with the trends in the original home of the settler as possible. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3525R|p.14]]

>Phillips writing of the universities in the Cape Colony suggests that their founding administrators were “keen to inculcate the cultural dominance of English into the new colony” (Phillips, 2003: 123) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3528R|p.14]]

>The mimesis of the universities in the metropole could be seen, according to Phillips (2003) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3531R|p.14]]

>“the very architecture of the seating in lecture rooms” was borrowed from Glasgow and Aberdeen (Phillips, 2003: 126) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3534R|p.14]]

>Later on the indigenous peoples conquered in the unjust wars of colonization were admitted into schools and universities. With the disseizing of the land and its resources which had previously provided for the subsistence of the African, the conquered were thus immediately thrust into a state of severe unnatural but structural, systematic and systemic poverty. In the face of this reality, the logic of survival compelled the conquered to abandon labor as a teleological positing and to enter into the new world of employment established unilaterally by the conqueror (Ramose 2002: 4). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3537R|p.14]]

>In the world of employment it was apparent that those with the benefit of “Western Education” enjoyed better pay and more bearable work, so the older people were forced to recognize the benefits of the education that the missionaries and state over time imposed on Africans. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3540R|p.14]]

>From the side of the colonizer who increasingly recognized the value of and encouraged the education of Africans, it was to serve the dual function of providing the job market with more skilled labor and in turn generate a new population of consumers of the products of Europe and those produced in the local factories. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=14&annotation=3543R|p.14]]

>The other purpose of education, supposedly an altruistic and humanitarian one was to civilize (humanize) the as yet “sub-human African” by introducing her to the culture, language, religion, values and knowledge of her supposedly superior conqueror [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&annotation=3546R|p.15]]

>As long ago as 1934 educationist Loram is quoted trying to explain the high-drop out and failure rates of the children of the indigenous conquered people in the formal education system of South Africa writing that “We have forced the Native child through a course of study which he can dimly conceive. We have taught him subjects foreign to his experience, and in a language which he cannot understand. At first, he comes to school eager to receive the education which he thinks has made the white man his master. For years [social pressure] causes him to continue [...] and when he wants to know the why and wherefore of things, he sees no meaning in his school work. He finds no satisfaction in doing the tasks given to him [...] no wonder he becomes listless in his school work, fails to satisfy those in authority, and either leaves school or remains there unwillingly" (Cited in McKerron, 1934: 174) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&annotation=3549R|p.15]]

>(South African Universities) It has a bias against and condescension towards “non-European” thought and even more especially against the African thought and experience. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&annotation=3552R|p.15]]

African scholars
>The reality in fact is that there is plenty of such scholarship coming out from all over the continent and throughout the African Diaspora (Mudimbe 1988, Oyewumi 2007, Adiume 2004) and this country specifically (Magubane 1970, Mafeje 1971, Nolutshungu 1975) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=15&annotation=3555R|p.15]]

>16 There are, of course, some exceptions in South Africa but in most cases where Africa is considered at all it is usually ghettoised, under the auspices of African Studies or Indigenous Knowledge Systems [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3558R|p.16]]

>contemporary meaning of “ghetto” is “a part of the city, especially slum area, occupied by a minority group”, its original meaning referred to “the quarter of the city, chiefly Italy where Jews were restricted”. Ghettoising comes to mean then both placement of someone in an inferior and precarious place subtracting from equal citizenship as well as an ethnic quarantine where those ghettoised are identified for particular ethnic or racial reasons. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3561R|p.16]]

>American is silently prefixed against other disciplines or studies, its existence in Africa suggests precisely that all else, that is, those disciplines which are not specifically pre-fixed with “African” are not African. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3564R|p.16]]

>The reason for the foregoing is the persistence of doubt concerning the reality or quality of African knowledge and the importance and value of the experience which brings it about. It is a doubt which has its philosophical foundation in the racist doubt concerning the humanity of Africans themselves. In the academe it is largely the reason for which we continue merely to have universities in Africa rather than African universities. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3567R|p.16]]

# Some General Characteristics of South African Philosophy
>In an article entitled Philosophy in South Africa Under and After Apartheid, Mabogo More argues that apartheid was merely the name of a juridical specification of a long existent, violent and racist colonialism which properly started in 1652 with the arrival of the Dutch. Apartheid as such then has limited historical significance and is often used in obfuscatory manner to distort the length of time over which liberation has been outstanding and to deflect attention from the conquest of indigenous people in the unjust wars of colonization [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3570R|p.16]]

>More writes “the name ‘apartheid’ emerged- in its legal sense- in 1948 as a means of strengthening and perfecting an already existing system of racial discrimination and domination rooted in attitudes of whites ever since they came into contact with the African” [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3573R|p.16]]

<u>There have been two basic traditions of colonialism in South Africa</u>
the **Dutch** and the **British** [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=16&annotation=3576R|p.16]]

>The evidence of these two “traditions” may be seen in the systems of law in South African history which are still dominant today, as well as in language, culture and education [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3579R|p.17]]

# The Afrikaans-Continental Tradition
>The beginnings of institutionalized philosophy in South Africa were at the theological school in Stellenbosch in the mid-19th century [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3582R|p.17]]

>Several Afrikaans universities were then formed in the Orange Free State, Pretoria and Potchefstroom. Amongst early notables were Dr WA Macfayden who began teaching ethics and political science at the University of Pretoria in 1911 and was appointed as Professor of philosophy and political science the following year where he taught until his death in 1924. Amongst the assortment of offerings he introduced during his tenure were essentials of later apartheid thought such as city planning and eugenics. (Duvenhage, 2008:110) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3585R|p.17]]

>According to Duvenhage, what one sees in a study of the development of institutionalized philosophy at the Afrikaans universities during the 20th century, for instance at Stellenbosch, is the influence “of a certain blend of continental philosophy and Protestant theology (influenced by the powerful Dutch Reformed Church). This is evident, for example, in the works of Kirsten, Degenaar and Rossouw. He suggests that even in Pretoria the trend was the same but observes that the Pretorians Rautenbach, Oberholzer and Dreyer were more conservative. (Duvenhage, 2008:112) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3588R|p.17]]

>According to More (2004), there developed from the religious and cultural traditions of the Afrikaner people- a certain distinct Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean tradition especially at Potchefstroom. Many of the advocates of this philosophy studied in Europe under philosophers such as Schelling, Herder or Fichte and were under the influence of mostly Dutch and German philosophers (More 2004: 151) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3591R|p.17]]

>From Fichte the concept of nature was invoked to justify the maintenance of separation between groups of different languages as well as his view of the individual sub-ordinate aspect of the Absolute Spirit which reveals itself historically in the life of the community [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3594R|p.17]]

>Once apartheid had commenced (after 1948) most Afrikaans university philosophers explicitly defended it. A variety of approaches were employed towards this end including Rawls’s Theory of Justice (More 2004: p.153). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=17&annotation=3597R|p.17]]

>It was, however, Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology which were put to greatest misuse. Phenomenology, for instance, was the basis of the apartheid state’s philosophy of education Fundamentiele Pedagogie (Fundamental Pedagogy) the development of which was headed by the Afrikaans University of Potchefstroom for Christian Higher Education (ibidem) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3600R|p.18]]

>Writing of the Afrikaner secret society known as Broederbond in 1978, political journalists Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom (2012: 14-15) state that: “The Broederbond has an abiding passion for control of education because of the obvious advantages this holds for any organization wishing to influence the minds and lives of young people. Consequently its representation in the top echelons of all the Afrikaans speaking universities is extremely strong.” [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3603R|p.18]]

>Prof Nico Diederichs was by far the most famous broeder philosopher, going on to become the first vice-chancellor of the Rand Afrikaans Universiteit (later the University of Johannesburg) and Finance Minister before becoming State President of South Africa in 1975. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3606R|p.18]]

>Before his rise to academic administration and politics, Nico Diederichs had been chair of political philosophy at the University of the Orange Free State and had studied in both Holland and Germany (Moodie, 1975: 154), had made many politically relevant contributions in his academic career. He had, for example, theorized a social metaphysics opposed to human equality in his Nasionalisme as Lewesbeskouing en sy Verhouding tot Internationalisme (Nationalism as a Weltenshaaung and Its Relation to Internationalism) (Moodie, 1975: 154). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3609R|p.18]]

>“Only through his consecration to, his love for and his service to the nation can man come to the versatile development of his existence. Only in the nation as the most total and inclusive human community can man realise himself to the full. The nation is a fulfilment of the individual life.”(cited in Moodie, 1975: 154). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3612R|p.18]]

>“and one man is more human than another to the extent that the spiritual powers within him are more expressed and developed … The only equality which must be accepted is the equality of opportunity for each to bring that which is within him to full expression”(Moodie, 1975: 154). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=18&annotation=3615R|p.18]]

>At the University of South Africa as well there was Herman de Vleeschauwer a Kant specialist who was Chair of the Philosophy Department from 1951 through to 1965. A professor who was an escaped convict for Nazi-war crimes committed during the German occupation of Belgium during the Second World War. (Delport, 2015: 9)  [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=19&annotation=3618R|p.19]]

# The Anglo-Saxon Tradition
>Academic philosophy at English speaking universities began at the University of the Cape of Good Hope established in 1873(More 2004 and Duvenhage 2007). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=19&annotation=3621R|p.19]]

> One of the first philosophers to occupy the chair of philosophy at the South African College (later the University of Cape Town {UCT}) was R.F.A. Hoernlé. He became one of the major figures in the intellectual formulation of South African liberalism (More 2004: 153). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=19&annotation=3624R|p.19]]

> The University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), Hoernlé stressed the significance of liberalism in a multiracial society such as South Africa. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=19&annotation=3627R|p.19]]

>A text he authored in 1939 with the title South African Native Policy and the Liberal spirit argued for racial separation as opposed to assimilation or parallelism (More 2004: 153). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3630R|p.20]]

> “both the Anglo-Saxon and Continental traditions may have been used to provide justification for racial and cultural discrimination before official apartheid in 1948 and during apartheid in the years that followed”. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3633R|p.20]]

>The analytic philosophers took what has been described by some as a “neutralist position.” (More 2004:154) The proponents of this position held that philosophy ought to be pursued for its own sake without involving itself in social and political issues of its day.  [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3636R|p.20]]

>More summarizes their argument as follows “since according to [them] philosophy is a second-order activity concerned mainly with the logical analysis of concepts, the task of the philosopher is therefore the clarification of the logic of concepts and their meaning. Social and political issues are not accordingly the task of the philosopher qua philosopher but qua active citizen.” (More, 2004: 154)  [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3639R|p.20]]

>Teresa Barnes writes about how the English speaking universities have, as with most individual politicians and activists, been over-celebrated for their “struggle” and “resistance” against apartheid. This mostly through the slanted discussion of their quest for academic freedom and students they produced who became antiapartheid activists. She makes the focus of her paper an examination of the extent to which the English-speaking or so-called ‘open universities’ were complicit in the sustenance and support for apartheid in South Africa. Dealing in particular with the case of UCT’s philosophy department, some interesting details about that university’s departmental history emerge which contradict the idea that philosophers “Stayed Out of Politics” to use Aronson’s phrase (1990). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3642R|p.20]]

>Professor Andrew Howson Murray, who held the chair of UCT’s department of philosophy and ethics from 1937-1970 was a well-known and widely employed collaborator and agent of the apartheid regime. In the course of his academic work Murray, for instance, contributed chapters to volumes published in honour of two conservative South African philosophers the Belgian ex-Nazi fugitive Herman de Vleeschauwer of Unisa and Stoker of the University of Potchefstroom (Barnes, 2015: 21) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3645R|p.20]]

>Barnes writes “As a philosopher and educator, Murray’s perspective was that the concept of pluralism was the only answer to the challenges of life in a multi-racial society. Although in other settings pluralism can be a reasonable call for democratic decentralization, in Murray’s hands it was deformed into an apology for apartheid” (Barnes, 2015: 22).  [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3648R|p.20]]

>Barnes draws on a variety of his writings as well as of his students’ marked copies of examination papers to support her reading that for Murray pluralism became a “euphemistic legitimation for injustice”(Barnes, 2015: 23). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3651R|p.20]]

>It is arguable but one might suggest that an Ethics professor’s most significant work can happen outside of the classroom. Murray appeared as the state’s anti-communist expert in the Treason Trial where he was “brought in as a state witness by the pro-Nazi, chief prosecutor Oswald Pirow” (Barnes, 2015: 24).Murray’s main task as expert witness was to identify the accused’s writings as “communist” [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=20&annotation=3654R|p.20]]

>The defense famously successfully had him unknowingly analyze his own earlier writings which he classified as communist (Barnes, 2015: 24). According to Barnes, Murray continued to testify against anti-apartheid activists well into the 1980s. Murray also worked for the Publications Appeal Board (the main South African censorship body from the 1960s until the 1980s). (Barnes, 2015: 25) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&annotation=3657R|p.21]]

>According to Barnes, “Murray was the head of the political committee of the Board and wrote many opinions that were central in the Board’s decisions to ban books and silence authors of critical political materials” (Barnes, 2015: 25). He in some instances recommended authors be investigated by military intelligence. Barnes goes on to show that he was not the only professor at UCT who worked for the apartheid regime but that there were countless, spies and agents at the so-called open universities who did such work [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&annotation=3660R|p.21]]

>Liberalism has historically been predominantly the political tradition of English speaking South Africa. It has also been rejected numerously from within the ranks of African politics [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&annotation=3663R|p.21]]

> At one stage by the ANC Youth League of Anton Lembede which saw liberals as trustees that were stifling African political development and agency (Maloka, 2014: 85). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&annotation=3666R|p.21]]

>Liberals were criticized a political hypocrites in pursuit of the enjoyment of the moral reputation of rejecting white supremacy while enjoying it fully. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=21&annotation=3669R|p.21]]

# The contemporary practice of philosophy and the marginality of African philosophy
>“Coloured” - a veritable ethical aberration and an ill-conceived political ploy to deny the humanity of the “Coloured” – together with the South African Indian also formed part of the struggle against colonial and racial injustice in South Africa. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=22&annotation=3672R|p.22]]
