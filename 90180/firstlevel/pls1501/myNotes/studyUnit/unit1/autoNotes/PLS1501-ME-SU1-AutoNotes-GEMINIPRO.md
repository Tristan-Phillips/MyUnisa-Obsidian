**PLS 1501: Introduction to Philosophy (Focus: Race, Philosophy, and South African Context)**

**I. Introduction: The South African Constitution and Non-Racialism**

*   **The 1996 Constitution:**  The Republic of South Africa's Constitution (Act 108 of 1996) establishes a democratic state founded on, among other values, "non-racialism and non-sexism." This is a foundational principle aimed at overcoming the legacy of apartheid.
*   **Non-Racialism vs. Anti-Racism:**
    *   **Anti-Racialism (Dominant Conception):**  This approach, drawing from philosopher Theo David Goldberg, seeks to eliminate racial categories altogether ("racism without races"). The idea is that by removing racial classifications, discrimination will cease.
    *   **Critique of Anti-Racialism:** The text argues that this approach fails to address the *consequences* of historical racism.  It doesn't restore lost freedoms, justice, dignity, or equality to victims, nor does it address the unjustly gained privileges of the beneficiaries of racism.  It leaves the structures of inequality intact.
    *   **Origins of Anti-Racialism in South Africa:**  This conception is linked to Cape Liberalism, originating from English-speaking settler populations.  Like Afrikaner Nationalism, it's argued to be based on an unquestioned "right of conquest" rooted in Western philosophy.
    *   **Anti-Racism (Alternative Conception):** **[ADDED CONTEXT]** Anti-racism, in contrast to anti-racialism, actively challenges and dismantles racist structures, policies, and attitudes.  It acknowledges the ongoing reality of race and racism and works to achieve equity.

*   **The Paradox of Justice:**  Victims of historical racism, when pursuing social justice, are often accused of being racist under the anti-racialist framework. This highlights a fundamental tension in the South African context.
*    **1652:** the start of the multi-century war of liberation.

**II. The Study of Racism and Philosophy**

*   **Critical Philosophy of Race:**  This emerging field argues that racism is a philosophically relevant topic, impacting philosophy in two key ways:
    1.  **Complicity of (Western) Philosophy:**  Western philosophy has historically contributed to the theoretical foundations of racism, either explicitly or implicitly.  This calls for critical self-reflection within the discipline.
    2.  **Philosophy's Role in Understanding Racism:**  Even where philosophy wasn't directly responsible, it has the tools to analyze the origins, nature, and workings of racism, contributing to a deeper understanding of the problem.

*   **The "Whiteness" of Philosophy (Charles Mills):**
    *   **Conceptual/Theoretical Whiteness:**  Mills argues that philosophy has a "whiteness" that goes beyond the demographics of its practitioners.  It refers to the dominant frameworks, concepts, and perspectives, which often exclude or marginalize non-Western thought.
    *   **Self-Sustaining Dynamic:** This "whiteness" discourages Black scholars from pursuing philosophy, perpetuating a "monochromatic" character within the discipline.  This leads to a lack of challenge to dominant assumptions.
    *   **Under-representation and Ignorance:**  The historical victims of racism are underrepresented in academic philosophy in South Africa, and there's a continued ignorance of African philosophy.

**III. Racism, the Eurocentric University, and the Marginality of African Philosophy in South Africa**

*   **The Colonial Origins of South African Education:**
    *   **Mimicking the Metropole:** Schools and universities were initially established by European settlers to maintain ties with their "home" countries (e.g., Britain).  Curricula, teaching methods, and even architecture were imported.
    *   **Cultural Dominance:**  The aim was to instill the cultural dominance of the colonizers (e.g., English cultural dominance in the Cape Colony).
    *   **Structural Poverty and Employment:**  The dispossession of land and resources forced the indigenous population into a state of structural poverty, compelling them to seek "Western Education" for better employment opportunities.
    *   **Dual Function of Education for Colonizers:**  Education of Africans served to:
        1.  Provide skilled labor for the colonial economy.
        2.  Create a new consumer base for European goods.
        3.  "Civilize" the supposedly "sub-human" African, imposing European culture, language, religion, and values.

*   **The Alienation of African Students:**  Early educationists (e.g., Loram, 1934) noted the high dropout and failure rates of African children, attributing it to the foreign nature of the curriculum and language of instruction.  This highlights the cultural disconnect and lack of relevance.

*   **Universities *in* Africa vs. *African* Universities:**
    *   **Eurocentric Bias:** South African universities are characterized by a bias against and condescension towards "non-European" thought, particularly African thought and experience.
    *   **Ghettoization of African Studies:**  African Studies and Indigenous Knowledge Systems are often marginalized and treated as separate, inferior fields, implying that other disciplines are inherently "non-African."
    *   **Doubt about African Knowledge:**  This marginalization stems from a racist doubt about the humanity of Africans and the validity of their knowledge systems.

* **Abundance of African Scholarship:** Many scholars in the continent and diaspora.

**IV. Some General Characteristics of South African Philosophy**

*   **Apartheid as a Juridical Specification of Colonialism:**  Mabogo More argues that apartheid (formally instituted in 1948) was a legal codification of a much older system of racist colonialism that began with the arrival of the Dutch in 1652.  The focus on apartheid can obscure the longer history of oppression.
*   **Two Colonial Traditions:**  South Africa's colonial history is marked by two main traditions:
    1.  **Dutch:**  Influenced Afrikaner culture, language, and legal systems (Roman-Dutch law).
    2.  **British:**  Influenced English-speaking culture, language, and legal systems (Common law).
    *   These influences are still evident in South African society today.

**V. The Afrikaans-Continental Tradition**

*   **Theological Roots:**  Institutionalized philosophy in South Africa began in theological schools (e.g., Stellenbosch) in the mid-19th century.
*   **Influence of Continental Philosophy and Protestant Theology:**  Afrikaans universities were heavily influenced by a blend of continental philosophy (especially German idealism) and Protestant theology (Dutch Reformed Church).
*   **Key Figures and Ideas:**
    *   **Dr. W.A. Macfayden (University of Pretoria):**  Introduced ethics, political science, city planning, and eugenics – elements that would later inform apartheid thought.
    *   **Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean Tradition (Potchefstroom):**  Drew on concepts of nature and the Absolute Spirit to justify racial separation and hierarchy.  Many scholars studied under influential European philosophers.
    *   **Phenomenology and *Fundamentiele Pedagogie*:**  Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology were misused to justify apartheid's philosophy of education, which aimed to control and shape the minds of young people.
    *   **The *Broederbond*:**  A secret Afrikaner society with significant influence in Afrikaans universities, promoting Afrikaner nationalism and controlling education.
    *   **Prof. Nico Diederichs:**  A prominent *Broederbond* philosopher and politician who developed a social metaphysics opposed to human equality, arguing for the fulfillment of individuals through the nation.

*   **Defense of Apartheid:**  Most Afrikaans university philosophers explicitly defended apartheid, using various philosophical approaches, including Rawls's Theory of Justice and, most notably, phenomenology.
* **Herman de Vleeschauwer:** Kant specialist, chair of philosophy at UNISA and Nazi-war crimes convict.

**VI. The Anglo-Saxon Tradition**

*   **Origins at the University of the Cape of Good Hope (1873):**  Academic philosophy at English-speaking universities began with a focus on liberalism.
*   **R.F.A. Hoernlé (University of Cape Town):**  A key figure in South African liberalism who advocated for racial separation, not assimilation or parallelism, in a multiracial society.
*   **"Neutralist Position" of Analytic Philosophers:**  Many analytic philosophers claimed to be apolitical, focusing on the logical analysis of concepts rather than engaging with social and political issues.  This is criticized as a form of tacit complicity with the status quo.
*   **Complicity of "Open Universities":**  Teresa Barnes challenges the narrative that English-speaking universities were bastions of resistance against apartheid.  She highlights the involvement of academics in supporting the regime.
*   **Prof. Andrew Howson Murray (University of Cape Town):**
    *   A prominent philosopher and ethics professor who collaborated with the apartheid government.
    *   Advocated for "pluralism" as a justification for racial segregation.
    *   Served as an anti-communist expert witness in the Treason Trial.
    *   Worked for the Publications Appeal Board, censoring books and silencing critical voices.

*   **Critique of Liberalism:**  Liberalism, while often presented as opposing white supremacy, was criticized by some African political movements (e.g., the ANC Youth League) for maintaining the privileges of white supremacy while enjoying a moral reputation for opposing it.

**VII. The Contemporary Practice of Philosophy and the Marginality of African Philosophy**

*   **Ongoing Struggle:**  The text concludes by emphasizing that the struggle for authentic political liberation and economic freedom is ongoing in South Africa. The contestation between "coloured", South African Indian and African people and the struggle against racial injustice is ongoing.

**Key Concepts and Themes:**

*   **Non-Racialism vs. Anti-Racism:** A crucial distinction for understanding the South African context.
*   **Critical Philosophy of Race:**  A field challenging the historical and ongoing role of philosophy in relation to racism.
*   **Eurocentrism:**  The dominance of European perspectives and knowledge systems in education and academia.
*   **Colonialism and Apartheid:**  The historical context shaping South African society and philosophy.
*   **Complicity:**  The ways in which individuals and institutions, even those claiming neutrality, can support oppressive systems.
*   **Marginalization:**  The exclusion and silencing of African perspectives and knowledge.
*   **Liberation:**  The ongoing struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.
* **Cape Liberalism:** a philosophy originating from the English-speaking settlers.
