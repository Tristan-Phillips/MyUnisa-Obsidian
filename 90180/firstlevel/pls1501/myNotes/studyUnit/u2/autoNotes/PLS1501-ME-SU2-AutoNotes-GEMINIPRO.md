**PLS1501: Introduction to Philosophy – Unit: The Pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle**

**I. Introduction: The Nature of Philosophical Inquiry**

*   **The Caricature of the Philosopher:**  The text begins by addressing a common, outdated stereotype of the philosopher as an isolated, detached academic. It emphasizes the shift towards a more holistic view of thinking, incorporating perception and feeling ("perfink" – Bruner, 1986).
*   **Historical Context:**  Philosophers, even revolutionary ones, are products of their time. Understanding their historical context is crucial for interpreting their ideas.  This includes understanding prevailing worldviews and how they shaped philosophical questions.
    *   **Example:**  Julian Jaynes' (1990) theory of the bicameral mind suggests that ancient people might have literally "heard the voice of God" due to a different structure of consciousness.
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Epistemology:** The study of knowledge, truth, belief, and justification.  It asks: *How do we know what we know? What is the nature of truth?*
    *   **Metaphysics:** The study of fundamental reality, including questions about existence, substance, cause, and effect. It asks: *What is the nature of being? What is ultimately real?*
* **Learning outcome:** explain why we need to understand the history of philosophy before we can understand what philosophy is

**II. What is Philosophy?**

*   **Provisional Definition:** Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the *what*, *how*, and *why* of existence.
*   **Philosophical Method:** A continuous process of:
    1.  **Provisional Definition:** Starting with a common-sense understanding of a concept.
    2.  **Analysis and Critique:** Examining the definition, exploring its implications, and identifying inconsistencies.
    3.  **Revision and Refinement:** Modifying the definition based on the critique, leading to a new theory.
    4.  **Dialogue and Debate:**  The history of philosophy is a continuous discussion, with issues remaining relevant to contemporary thought.
*   **Knowledge as Evolutionary:** Philosophical knowledge isn't strictly "true" or "false," but rather more or less biologically and evolutionarily useful.  This highlights the pragmatic aspect of philosophical inquiry.
*   **Philosophy as a "Love of Wisdom":** Derived from the Greek *philein* (to love) and *sophia* (wisdom).

**III. Philosophy and the History of Philosophy**

*   **Interdependence:**  Modern philosophy is deeply rooted in the work of previous philosophers.  To understand contemporary thought, we must understand its historical development.
*   **Rethinking Past Theories:**  We don't just study past theories; we must actively engage with them, redeveloping them in our own thinking to generate new ideas.
*   **Example:** pre-17th-century reliance on authority over observation.
*   **Learning outcome:** give an account of the Arche as found in the concepts of the Milesian philosophers identify the various relevant features of pre-Socratic thought that constitute the philosophical background to Socrates's approach to philosophy

**IV. The Beginnings of Philosophical Thinking in Greece**

*   **From Myth to Philosophy:**  Greek philosophy emerged as a departure from mythological explanations of the world.  This transition involved a shift from accepting sensory impressions uncritically to seeking rational explanations.
*   **Mythological Thought:**
    *   Characterized by anthropomorphic interpretations of natural phenomena.
    *   Homeric mythology was a central part of Greek culture and public worship.
    *   Sought to establish order but relied on uncritical acceptance of sensory experience.
*   **The Milesian School (6th Century BCE):**  Generally considered the starting point of Greek philosophy.
    *   **Location:** Miletus, on the Ionian coast.
    *   **Key Figures:** Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes.
    *   **Economic Context:**  The shift from an agricultural to a maritime lifestyle in Miletus likely contributed to the interest in understanding natural patterns.
*   **The Quest for the *Arche* (First Cause):** The Milesians were preoccupied with identifying the fundamental principle or substance underlying the cosmos.
    *   **Monism:** The belief that a single element is more fundamental than others. This contrasts with the traditional view of four elements (air, earth, fire, water).

**V. Pre-Socratic Philosophers: The Quest for the Arche**

*   **Thales (c. 625-545 BCE):**
    *   **Arche:** Water.
    *   **Reasoning:**  Observed that water appears to be essential to life and can transform into other states (evaporation, rain, etc.).  Also considered the geological relationship between water and earth.
*   **Anaximander (c. 611-545 BCE):**
    *   **Arche:** The *apeiron* (the unlimited or indefinite).
    *   **Reasoning:**  Criticized Thales' view, arguing that water is quantitatively exhaustible.  The *apeiron* is an inexhaustible, unmixed source from which all things arise and to which they return. He proposed the existence of multiple cosmos.
*   **Anaximenes (c. 585-525 BCE):**
    *   **Arche:** Air.
    *   **Mechanism:** Condensation and rarefaction.
    *   **Reasoning:**  Observed that air can change its density and appearance (e.g., breath being cold when compressed, hot when relaxed).  This provided a single, quantitative process to explain all physical changes.
*    **Feedback:** The pre-socratics focused on understanding the natural world and searched for the most simple form for which to explain it.
*   **Other Significant Pre-Socratics:**
    *   **Heraclitus (c. 540-470 BCE):**
        *   **Central Idea:**  Constant change ("One cannot step into the same river twice").
        *   **Arche:** Fire (symbolizing the constant process of transformation).
        *   **Logos:** The unchanging principle of change itself.  The *logos* states that all things are constituted by the union of opposites, a tension driving them towards transformation.
        *   **Cratylus (disciple):**  Took Heraclitus's ideas to their extreme, arguing that constant change undermines the possibility of stable meaning and communication.
    *   **Parmenides (c. 540-480 BCE):**
        *   **Central Idea:** Change is an illusion.  True being is one, uncreated, and indestructible.
        *   **Reasoning:**  Used a strict logical argument:  Something cannot come from nothing, and "what is" cannot become "what is not."  Therefore, true change is impossible.
        *   **The Way of Truth vs. The Way of Belief:**  Distinguished between the rational understanding of being (The Way of Truth) and the illusory world of appearances (The Way of Belief).
* **Feedback:** The monist position, although revised, was upheld through the Pre-Socratic era.

**VI. The Sophists (5th Century BCE)**

*   **Professional Educators:**  Focused on rhetoric and persuasion rather than the pursuit of absolute truth.  Compared to modern corporate lawyers (Bertrand Russell).
*   **Shift in Focus:** From explaining nature to explaining human conduct and relationships.
*   **Key Ideas:**
    *   **Relativism:**  There is no objective truth, only subjective opinion.
    *   **Skepticism:**  The riddle of the universe is unsolvable.
    *   **Emphasis on Persuasion:**  The goal of argument is to win, not to discover truth.
*   **Modern Relevance:**  Postmodern philosophers often adopt a Sophist-like stance, emphasizing the contingency and contextuality of knowledge.
*   **Quote (Caputo, 1993):**  Highlights the fragility of life and the absence of overarching meaning in events.

**VII. Socrates (c. 470-399 BCE)**

*   **No Written Records:**  Our knowledge of Socrates comes primarily from Plato's dialogues.
*   **The Socratic Method:**  A systematic questioning process aimed at arriving at a defensible definition of a concept.
    *   **Goal:** To uncover the *essential nature* of something.
    *   **Argument of Negativity:**  Rejecting definitions based on mere examples or circular reasoning.
    *   **Testing by Reasoning:**  Using the proposed definition as a premise in an argument and examining the consequences for contradictions or conflicts with observed facts.
*   **Example: The Dialogue with Laches:**  Demonstrates the Socratic method in action, exploring the definition of courage.
*   **Philosophical Scope:**  Socrates expanded philosophical inquiry to include ethics, politics, and epistemology, in addition to metaphysics.
* **Feedback:** Both were teachers of philosophy but differed in their approach to knowledge.

**VIII. Plato (c. 428-348 BCE)**

*   **Central Belief:**  The world we perceive through our senses is not fully real; it is a world of change and decay.  There must be a world of stable, perfect objects (Forms) behind the changing appearances.
*   **Theory of Knowledge (Epistemology):**
    *   **Knowledge is Virtue (Arête):**  *Arête* refers to excellence or performing one's function well.  Human *arête* is being good at being human.
    *   **Knowledge is Necessary Truth:**  Only what is necessarily true and beyond doubt can be considered knowledge.  Contingent truths are matters of opinion or belief.
    *   **Rational Intuition:**  Knowledge is accessed through the "mind's eye," not through sensory perception.
    *   **The Role of the Senses:**  The senses can mislead and distort our judgment, hindering the pursuit of knowledge.
    *   **The Soul and Thinking:**  Wisdom is achieved through pure thinking, the soul's special activity.  The philosopher seeks to purify the soul from bodily contamination.
    *   **Mathematics as an Example:**  Mathematical concepts (unity, line, circle) are abstract and not perfectly realized in the material world, suggesting the existence of a realm of pure Forms.
*   **Theory of Forms (Universals):**
    *   **Distinction:** Knowledge (of the real) vs. Opinion (of what seems to be).
    *   **Being, Nonbeing, and Becoming:**  The object of opinion is a combination of being and nonbeing, called Becoming.
    *   **Characteristics of Forms:**  Unchanging, absolute, universal.
    *   **Examples:**  Beauty, Justice, Goodness, Horse, Mountain, etc.
    *   **Realist View:**  Forms exist independently of our minds.  Objects in the sensory world participate imperfectly in the Forms.
*   **The Allegory of the Cave:**  Illustrates the journey from ignorance (the cave) to knowledge (the world of Forms). The journey out of the cave is difficult.
*   **Doctrine of *Anamnesis* (Recollection):**
    *   **Dualism:**  The soul is immaterial and distinct from the body.
    *   **Immortality of the Soul:**  The soul pre-exists the body and returns to the world of Forms after death.
    *   **Forgetfulness and Recollection:**  The soul forgets the Forms when it enters the body.  Sensory experience can trigger a recollection of the Forms.
*   **Summary of Plato's Theory of Knowledge:**
    1.  Knowledge is permanent and certain.
    2.  Knowledge cannot be based on sense perception.
    3.  True belief can guide the mind to remember the Forms.
    4.  Forms are eternal and changeless, thus objects of knowledge.
    5.  Forms are accessed through the mind, not the senses.
    6.  Knowledge is acquired through the mind's capacity for recollection.
* **Feedback:** Platos theory of knowledge claims recollection is how humans can access the Forms.

**IX. Key Questions and Reflections (Points to Ponder and Feedback)**

*   **Why did the problem of the *arche* arise among the ancient Greeks?**  The changing lifestyle and increasing reliance on natural patterns likely prompted the search for underlying principles.
*   **How did Pre-Socratic dialogue advance the philosophical quest?**  Each philosopher built upon or critiqued the ideas of their predecessors, leading to a more refined understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.
*   **How does Socrates's claim to ignorance differ from the Sophists'?**  Socrates sought intellectual clarity as an end in itself, while the Sophists focused on rhetorical skill and persuasion.
* **Why did Plato think virtue depends on knowledge?** Only if one knows the good can one do the good.
* **Does Platos allegory of the cave explain how we come to have knowledge of the Forms?** No, the allegory only demonstrates the effects of having knowledge of the Forms.
*   **Do we need to suppose the existence of Forms and the pre-existence of the mind to explain mathematical knowledge?**  No, mathematical knowledge can be explained by understanding the meanings of terms and drawing deductive conclusions from axioms, which may be derived from experience.
