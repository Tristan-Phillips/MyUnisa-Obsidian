#### Learning Outcomes
<u>When you have completed this study unit, you should be able to</u>:
- explain why we need to understand the history of philosophy before we can understand what philosophy is
- give an account of the Arche as found in the concepts of the Milesian philosophers identify the various relevant features of pre-Socratic thought that constitute the philosophical background to Socrates's approach to philosophy
- explain and evaluate the theories of knowledge and reality proposed by Plato and Aristotle give an account of Aristotle's concepts of substance and cause by providing examples of the application of his doctrine of cause

# Introduction
>There is an awful caricature that, for good reason still exists in many people's minds. It is the picture of a philosopher who was a balding, middle aged, acerbic eccentric white male (usually a professor) who peruses a narrow band of knowledge found within ancient musty books and obscure academic journals. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3681R|p.23]]

>So that as the cliché goes he knows more and more about less and less. This disconnected modus operandi became epitomized and rightly caricatured [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3684R|p.23]]

> Sir Ken Robinson recently observed that possibly a university professor's body was only a biological machine to transport his mind to meetings. Today that has all changed. Maybe the idea of thinking as a detached mental process is outmoded, we should possibly use the neologism “perfink'' (i.e. we perceive, feel and think simultaneously (Bruner 1986:118). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3687R|p.23]]

>It would, in our estimation, be really tragic if the only philosophy you read this year was the study guide [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=7,0,13,49&color=red|p.24]]

>This means that despite often being revolutionary thinkers, a philosopher is trapped within her particular historical period's world view. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=37,0,41,76&color=yellow|p.24]]

>When you begin to understand the world views that many philosophers lived inside of, fascinating philosophical questions appear about the nature of human consciousness [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3690R|p.24]]

<u>Here are two examples</u>:
>1. Have you ever wondered how in ancient history some people claimed to literally “hear the voice of God?'' Well according to Julian Jaynes this might actually have occurred because of how the human mind was structured then, you can read more about that provocative thesis in The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind (1990) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3693R|p.24]]

> Their ideas differed from their predecessors in that their philosophy did not include myth. In various ways, the philosopher- scientists' elucidation of their ideas marks the origin of Western philosophy. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=103,30,151,0&color=yellow|p.24]]

>We shall briefly look at the opposing approaches of Parmenides and Heraclitus, whose significance as philosophers lies in the way in which Socrates and Plato both attempted to overcome the impasse created by their opposing views. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3696R|p.24]]

>We shall introduce you to the defining themes of all epistemological and metaphysical enquiry by giving you a detailed outline of Plato's theories of knowledge and reality. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3699R|p.24]]

>Epistemology is the study of the relationship between knowledge, truth, belief, and justification [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3702R|p.24]]

>metaphysics is the study of questions concerning the meaning of underlying substance and causal connections. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3705R|p.24]]

# What is Philosophy?
> All that is difficult and unfamiliar about it is the rigorous analysis of well- known concepts and ideas [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3708R|p.24]]

>The only way to discover what philosophy is, is to do it and to construct a definition as we proceed. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3711R|p.26]]

 >Let us begin with a very simplistic and provisional definition and then qualify and modify our definition as we become better acquainted with the discipline of philosophy. This is the traditional method of philosophizing, by the way: a continual debate, or running self-criticism, in which insights are acquired and developed by a continual discussion [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3714R|p.26]]
 
 >Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the what, the how and the why of existence [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3717R|p.26]]
 
 > Put in slightly more abstract terms A piece of [philosophical] knowledge is never false or true - but only more or less biologically and evolutionary useful. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3720R|p.26]]
 
 >All knowledge advances by discussion, including in the sciences. What is agreed and accepted is no longer of vital interest. The growing point of every branch of knowledge is the region of perpetual debate. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3723R|p.26]]
 
>Philosophising is a method which tries to define some concept provisionally, as that concept appears to common sense (eg the common sense concept of justice). The philosophical method will then examine the definition, develop its implications to discover whether these implications are self- consistent, and correct this definition wherever it is found wanting. In doing this, philosophising will lead to a different definition and a new theory of the defined concept. Philosophy will then proceed with a critique of this new definition and theory and, in the process; this will lead to more disagreement and more advancement. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3726R|p.26]]

>The history of philosophy also becomes a dialogue and a discussion one which is never stale or dead because the issues are still current and are always, in some way, directly or indirectly, the concern of every thinking person. (See Stumpf & Abel 2002:6;19; 551;566.) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3729R|p.26]]

# Philosophy and the History of Philosophy
>We cannot fully understand contemporary philosophy or what modern philosophers are doing apart from their historical background, because the work of modern philosophers is, to a very large extent, a reflection upon the work of their predecessors [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3732R|p.26]]

>Philosophy arises out of our ordinary everyday ideas and experiences [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3735R|p.27]]

>We take it for granted today that no theory about what happens in the world around us is of much value unless it is based upon, and can be tested by, observation and experiment. But before the 17th century this approach would not have occurred even to highly educated and intelligent people; until the 17th century, everyone would have almost certainly rejected personal observations in preference to statements backed by high authority. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3738R|p.27]]

>to properly understand these ideas, as philosophers we must know how and when they originated. And, to understand their history, we must not only study past theories, but must rethink them, redevelop them in our own thought, and thus enable ourselves to formulate new ideas that go beyond those of our predecessors [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3741R|p.27]]

>“Philosophy'' is derived from the Greek philein, literally meaning “to love'' and sophia meaning “wisdom'', so philosophy literally means the “love of wisdom'' [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3744R|p.27]]

# The Beginnings of the Philosophical Thinking in Greece
>Plato's philosophy is the product of reflection upon the thought of the two preceding centuries, one of the most intellectually productive periods of human history. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3747R|p.27]]

>In line with the method of contextualization of ancient Greek thought, we need to begin by briefly examining the principal features of Greek mythological thought [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3750R|p.27]]

>In mythological thought, the mind is held in thrall by sense impressions. Exposure to the world of natural phenomena led the people of ancient Greece to form anthropomorphic plastic images of these phenomena. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3753R|p.27]]

>The popularisation of these myths led to Homeric mythology becoming the object of public worship in Greek city-states such as Athens and Miletus. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3756R|p.28]]
