# Introduction
>There is an awful caricature that, for good reason still exists in many people's minds. It is the picture of a philosopher who was a balding, middle aged, acerbic eccentric white male (usually a professor) who peruses a narrow band of knowledge found within ancient musty books and obscure academic journals. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3681R|p.23]]

>So that as the cliché goes he knows more and more about less and less. This disconnected modus operandi became epitomized and rightly caricatured [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3684R|p.23]]

> Sir Ken Robinson recently observed that possibly a university professor's body was only a biological machine to transport his mind to meetings. Today that has all changed. Maybe the idea of thinking as a detached mental process is outmoded, we should possibly use the neologism “perfink'' (i.e. we perceive, feel and think simultaneously (Bruner 1986:118). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=23&annotation=3687R|p.23]]

>It would, in our estimation, be really tragic if the only philosophy you read this year was the study guide [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=7,0,13,49&color=red|p.24]]

>This means that despite often being revolutionary thinkers, a philosopher is trapped within her particular historical period's world view. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=37,0,41,76&color=yellow|p.24]]

>When you begin to understand the world views that many philosophers lived inside of, fascinating philosophical questions appear about the nature of human consciousness [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3690R|p.24]]

<u>Here are two examples</u>:
>1. Have you ever wondered how in ancient history some people claimed to literally “hear the voice of God?'' Well according to Julian Jaynes this might actually have occurred because of how the human mind was structured then, you can read more about that provocative thesis in The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind (1990) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3693R|p.24]]

> Their ideas differed from their predecessors in that their philosophy did not include myth. In various ways, the philosopher- scientists' elucidation of their ideas marks the origin of Western philosophy. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&selection=103,30,151,0&color=yellow|p.24]]

>We shall briefly look at the opposing approaches of Parmenides and Heraclitus, whose significance as philosophers lies in the way in which Socrates and Plato both attempted to overcome the impasse created by their opposing views. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3696R|p.24]]

>We shall introduce you to the defining themes of all epistemological and metaphysical enquiry by giving you a detailed outline of Plato's theories of knowledge and reality. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3699R|p.24]]

>Epistemology is the study of the relationship between knowledge, truth, belief, and justification [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3702R|p.24]]

>metaphysics is the study of questions concerning the meaning of underlying substance and causal connections. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3705R|p.24]]

# What is Philosophy?
> All that is difficult and unfamiliar about it is the rigorous analysis of well- known concepts and ideas [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=24&annotation=3708R|p.24]]

>The only way to discover what philosophy is, is to do it and to construct a definition as we proceed. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3711R|p.26]]

 >Let us begin with a very simplistic and provisional definition and then qualify and modify our definition as we become better acquainted with the discipline of philosophy. This is the traditional method of philosophizing, by the way: a continual debate, or running self-criticism, in which insights are acquired and developed by a continual discussion [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3714R|p.26]]
 
 >Philosophy is the rational justification of our intuitive perceptions about the what, the how and the why of existence [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3717R|p.26]]
 
 > Put in slightly more abstract terms A piece of [philosophical] knowledge is never false or true - but only more or less biologically and evolutionary useful. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3720R|p.26]]
 
 >All knowledge advances by discussion, including in the sciences. What is agreed and accepted is no longer of vital interest. The growing point of every branch of knowledge is the region of perpetual debate. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3723R|p.26]]
 
>Philosophising is a method which tries to define some concept provisionally, as that concept appears to common sense (eg the common sense concept of justice). The philosophical method will then examine the definition, develop its implications to discover whether these implications are self- consistent, and correct this definition wherever it is found wanting. In doing this, philosophising will lead to a different definition and a new theory of the defined concept. Philosophy will then proceed with a critique of this new definition and theory and, in the process; this will lead to more disagreement and more advancement. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3726R|p.26]]

>The history of philosophy also becomes a dialogue and a discussion one which is never stale or dead because the issues are still current and are always, in some way, directly or indirectly, the concern of every thinking person. (See Stumpf & Abel 2002:6;19; 551;566.) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3729R|p.26]]

# Philosophy and the History of Philosophy
>We cannot fully understand contemporary philosophy or what modern philosophers are doing apart from their historical background, because the work of modern philosophers is, to a very large extent, a reflection upon the work of their predecessors [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=26&annotation=3732R|p.26]]

>Philosophy arises out of our ordinary everyday ideas and experiences [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3735R|p.27]]

>We take it for granted today that no theory about what happens in the world around us is of much value unless it is based upon, and can be tested by, observation and experiment. But before the 17th century this approach would not have occurred even to highly educated and intelligent people; until the 17th century, everyone would have almost certainly rejected personal observations in preference to statements backed by high authority. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3738R|p.27]]

>to properly understand these ideas, as philosophers we must know how and when they originated. And, to understand their history, we must not only study past theories, but must rethink them, redevelop them in our own thought, and thus enable ourselves to formulate new ideas that go beyond those of our predecessors [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3741R|p.27]]

>“Philosophy'' is derived from the Greek philein, literally meaning “to love'' and sophia meaning “wisdom'', so philosophy literally means the “love of wisdom'' [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3744R|p.27]]

# The Beginnings of the Philosophical Thinking in Greece
>Plato's philosophy is the product of reflection upon the thought of the two preceding centuries, one of the most intellectually productive periods of human history. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3747R|p.27]]

>In line with the method of contextualization of ancient Greek thought, we need to begin by briefly examining the principal features of Greek mythological thought [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3750R|p.27]]

>In mythological thought, the mind is held in thrall by sense impressions. Exposure to the world of natural phenomena led the people of ancient Greece to form anthropomorphic plastic images of these phenomena. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=27&annotation=3753R|p.27]]

>The popularisation of these myths led to Homeric mythology becoming the object of public worship in Greek city-states such as Athens and Miletus. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3756R|p.28]]

>In mythological thought, there is an attempt at discerning and establishing order[[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3759R|p.28]]

>The essential difference between scientific/philosophical thought and mythological thought is that, in mythological thought, the mind is wrapped up in cosmic events to such an extent that the testimony of the senses is accepted and received in a naïve, and totally uncritical, manner. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3762R|p.28]]

>The evolution of philosophical thought from mythology may be seen as the outcome of humankind's changing experience of reality and the specific needs arising from this changing reality. This is why the concept of knowledge changes and why the first philosophers came into conflict with the advocates of the traditional values of the city-state, values that were based on the mythology of Homer [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3765R|p.28]]

>Greek philosophy is usually taken to begin in the 6th century BCE, with the Ionian School or the Milesians, named after the city of Miletus, on the Ionian coast. The three best-known of the Milesian philosophers were: Thales (±625-545 BC), Anaximander (± 611-545 BC), and Anaximenes (±585-525 BC) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3768R|p.28]]

>Greek philosophy is mainly the offspring, as it were, of material and economic needs and interests. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=28&annotation=3771R|p.28]]

# Pre-Socratic Philosophy: The Quest for The First Cause (Arche)
>The Milesians were all preoccupied by a single problem, namely: What is the first governing principle of the world by which chaos (unformed or amorphous matter) is turned into cosmos (formed or intelligible matter)? [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3774R|p.29]]

>The prevailing wisdom of the time, which was part of Greek mythology, was that there are four basic elements, namely Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3777R|p.29]]

>The Milesians disagreed with this view, and claimed that a single element was somehow more basic than the others. Such a reduction of the many (in this case, four) to the one is called monism. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3780R|p.29]]

#### Thales
>Thales suggested that the underlying first principle was Water. He may have thought that, if the initial state of things was a mass of water, and the earth arose out of water, what is underneath the earth, supporting it, but the water out of which it arose? If there was, in the beginning, nothing else to support water why should water need support now? [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3783R|p.29]]

<u>Another consideration linking the traditional view of the four elements is</u>:
> 1. The phenomenon of spring water gushing from the earth [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3786R|p.29]]
> 2. Water can be changed into air when it evaporates; water vapor becomes liquid as rain [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3789R|p.29]]
> 3. Water takes on the appearance of fire when a volcano erupts. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3792R|p.29]]

#### Anaximander
>Thales's view was criticized by fellow Milesian, Anaximander [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3795R|p.29]]

> Anaximander's purpose was to describe the inhabited earth geological, biological, and cultural. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3798R|p.29]]

>One of his most striking hypotheses is that the cosmos of earth, sun, moon, and stars is not unique. Anaximander claimed that there is, at any moment, an unlimited number of such worlds, all of which arise from “the unlimited'' (apeiron). [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3801R|p.29]]

>This apeiron is that from which all the worlds and all that is in them are separated out and into which they are again absorbed [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3804R|p.29]]

>Anaximander's objection to Thales is that, since water is quantitatively exhaustible, it could not be the arche. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=29&annotation=3807R|p.29]]

>The arche, therefore had to be something in which the elements rested in a perfectly unmixed state, hence his conception of the apeiron [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3810R|p.30]]

#### Anaximenes
>Anaximander's successor, Anaximenes [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3813R|p.30]]

>Anaximenes suggested a single natural operating mechanism, for which he found evidence in the physical world. This was the mechanism of condensation-rarefaction. All change of every kind he regarded as the result of this one mechanism. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3816R|p.30]]

>If we compress the air we exhale with our lips it appears cold; if we relax our lips in exhalation, it is rarefied and becomes hot. If then it is compressed further, it becomes water and finally earth and stones; but if further rarefied, it becomes fire. These changes of one thing into another are really an indication of a change in the density of the underlying element which Anaximenes called air. Anaximenes's analysis of all objects and events in the physical world as aspects and functions of a single quantitative process is the ultimate achievement of Milesian philosophy. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3819R|p.30]]

>Why do you think the problem of the arche arose when it did among the ancient Greeks? [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3822R|p.30]]

##### Feedback
>The lifestyle of the inhabitants of Miletus gradually changed from being an agricultural one to a maritime one. Their increasing reliance upon regularity in natural occurrences (tides, winds, etc.) encouraged them to find out as much as they could about the patterns in nature. However, just why they thought a single cause was better than a variety of causes is unclear, even today [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3825R|p.30]]

##### Points to ponder
>Anaximenes claimed that water is air that has been re-arranged by compression, and that air is water that has been re-arranged by rarefaction. Does it therefore follow that nothing is anything but a different degree of anything else, and that only the process itself remains fixed? If all is one and unchanging, how can it appear to be many and variable? [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3828R|p.30]]

# Other Significant Pre-Socratics
>The Milesians' crude materialistic approach to the problem of the Arche’ was opposed by both Heraclitus (± 540-470 BCE) and Parmenides (±540-480 BCE). Both thinkers thought that the arche was not accessible to sense perception, but could only be grasped by rational insight and intuition. Nor could the arche, like Anaximander's apeiron, merely be said to contain all the elements in an unmixed state. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=30&annotation=3831R|p.30]]

#### Heraclitus
>Rather than search for an underlying unity, Heraclitus got rid of the difficulty of reconciling permanence and change by claiming that nothing in the universe is permanent. Everything, he claimed, is continually changing. All things are in a constant state of flux. “One cannot step into the same river twice.'' Heraclitus regarded Fire as the ultimate reality because, like nature itself, Fire is forever passing away and renewing itself. The universe, he believed, was a perpetual conflagration in which solid earth melted to water and evaporated to air which was then transmuted into fire. Smoke and ash from fire descended upon earth and were rekindled into fire, thus beginning the cycle again. “The world is an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling and measures going out.' [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&annotation=3834R|p.31]]

>In addition to the doctrine of change, Heraclitus recognized a principle of nature which he called the logos. The logos is the principle that everything changes. It is a universal principle and remains unchanged. The logos states that all things pass into their opposites, or are constituted by the union of their opposites. The union is not permanent, but a tension between forces driving them either on the path to Fire which is, at the same time, the starting point of the endless repetition of the cycle of transformation. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&annotation=3837R|p.31]]

>Heraclitus's disciple, Cratylus, saw that if one took this theory seriously, no permanence would be left, not even the permanence of the law of change. If everything changes, even the words we use, the meanings they have will constantly change. In other words, we could not have a constant language to describe the world we live in. So Cratylus concluded that one cannot step into the same river even ONCE, because, by the time one stepped into it, the river had changed. Because he thought that word-meanings were constantly changing (indeed, the speaker, the words, their meanings, and the listener, all change), it is said that Cratylus therefore refused to make statements. Instead, he would just wiggle his little finger when spoken to, to indicate that he had heard. It would have been futile for Cratylus to make any response, for the universe would not stand still long enough for him to make his response [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&annotation=3845R|p.31]]

##### Implications of Cratylus's Thought
>In Cratylus's thought, it is clear that certain presuppositions (which we commonly make) about knowledge are in operation. To begin with, it is assumed that only what is true can rank as knowledge and that truth is absolute - either all or nothing. In other words, what is not quite true is not true at all and so is not knowledge. It is also assumed that what is true is always true, which means that the object of knowledge must be true and unchanging. What constantly changes cannot be an object of knowledge. What changes never remains (and so never properly is) what at any moment it is said to be. Instead, it is constantly becoming something else what it is not. It neither is nor is not precisely anything and yet it is both something and something else a very confusing state of affairs indeed! [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=31&annotation=3848R|p.31]]

#### Parmenides
>Parmenides took the view that what we call change is an illusion. One may briefly summarize his argument as follows: true change must mean that something that was not at one time, later comes into being. But how can something come into being? Only in one of two ways: either from something else or out of nothing. If it comes out of something else, it already existed; if it came out of nothing, then “nothing'' must be treated as though it had some being; otherwise it would be absurd to think that something could come out of nothing, or out of nonbeing. Either way, then, the phrase “comes into being'' must mean that what we call change refers to what already exists, in which case there is no real change [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&annotation=3851R|p.32]]

>What is could never have come into being, because that would imply a time when it was not when nothing was which is impossible. It could not come into being from what is other than being, because there is nothing other than being. For the same reason, “what is'' cannot cease to be for then it would pass into what is not being and that, too, is impossible. Likewise, if being is identical with itself, it must be indivisible because if “what is not, is not'' and “being is'', it follows that what could divide any one portion of it from any other could only be “what is not''. If it were anything else, it would be identical with being and there would be no division. It follows, further, that no part of being can be other than or different from any other part of being, because what is other would be other than being not being and there is no not being, and so no other. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&annotation=3859R|p.32]]

>Parmenides concluded thus that being is one, uncreated and indestructible. There is no “other'' and so there cannot be a “many'' or more than one. Because there cannot be a change within the one, there can be no movement, for movement is a form of change. There is no place where “what is'' is not, so “what is'' cannot move. Consequently all variety, movement, multiplicity, difference, and so on, is illusory and mere appearance. The theories describing the world in these terms are what Parmenides called “The Way of Belief '' as opposed to his way, which was “The Way of Truth'' [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&annotation=3862R|p.32]]

>The significance of this logical, but peculiar, argument is seen when we contrast it with the views of Heraclitus. Whereas Heraclitus recommends disregarding sensation and paying attention to a logos which we may discover through introspection, Parmenides denies that introspection is any more reliable than sensation. The logos which Parmenides recommends us to follow is pure reason, which is the source of Being itself: the structure of rational thought reflects the nature of Being itself. Parmenides's argument sets out to prove that the identity of what is precludes the possibility of any characteristic except just being. The essential nature of Being, the inner necessity that a thing is identical with itself, does not permit it to come to be nor to pass away. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=32&annotation=3865R|p.32]]

##### Points to ponder
- [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3868R|Pre-Socratic thinkers were especially preoccupied with the search for the single substance (the One) underlying the apparent diversity (the Many) in nature. Explain how their interaction in dialogue advanced the philosophical quest.]]

##### Feedback
>The groundwork for the thought of the ancient Milesian cosmologists was the then current theory that the world consists of four basic elements (air, earth, fire, and water). All preSocratic philosophers, however, considered that ONE element was more basic than any other (they were monists). Thales decided that water is somehow the most basic element. Anaximander disagreed and settled upon an unspecified element that he saw as undergoing transformation. Anaximenes was unhappy with the vague account of transformation suggested by Anaximander and suggested another element and, more importantly, a detailed account of the process. Heraclitus took a broader view of the process of transformation and identified fire as the symbol of eternal change. Parmenides totally disagreed with him and, indeed, with all his predecessors. Parmenides tried to show the contradiction involved in speaking about change when the language of change is subjected to strict logical analysis. His peculiar conceptual logic serves to elucidate some of the implications of such strict logical thought. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3871R|p.33]]

# The Sophists
>The Sophists were a group of 5th century (BCE) professional educators. They did not pursue truth for its own sake but, instead, counselled their students or clients on how to win their cases before the law courts [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3874R|p.33]]

>The 20th century British philosopher Bertrand Russell compared the Sophists to American corporate lawyers! The Sophists emphasised persuasion rather than knowledge as the ultimate goal of argument. They represent a shift in interest away from the problems of explaining nature to the problems of explaining human conduct and relationships [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3877R|p.33]]

<u>The following principal ideas were characteristic of the Sophists' approach to knowledge</u>:
- Philosophy has proved that no two philosophers think alike. If there is no change, there can be no knowledge because, in that case, we cannot describe anything. (Because description implies that a thing which is identical with itself is also something else.) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3880R|p.33]]
- If things change, the same is true because, where nothing persists, we cannot attribute anything to anything [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3883R|p.33]]
- If we can know things only in so far as they influence our senses, we also cannot know, because then the nature of things eludes our grasp. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3886R|p.33]]
- We cannot solve the riddle of the universe [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3889R|p.33]]

>The Sophistic position on knowledge is that there is no objective truth - only subjective opinion. The individual is a law unto himself in the matter of knowledge [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=33&annotation=3892R|p.33]]

##### Points to ponder
<u>There seem to be two sets of laws that operate in the world</u>:
- The laws of nature, gravity being the obvious one. If I decide to jump out of a 5 story building I will hit the ground and the impact will kill me. Everybody else who similarly attempts this feat without a safety net will in all probability also die. The laws of nature thus appear to be universal [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&annotation=3895R|p.34]]
- Then there are laws that appear to belong to particular societies. For example different religious groups stop work and celebrate different days of the year they deem sacred. These laws for these observances only apply to followers of these societies. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&annotation=3898R|p.34]]
>In our day many postmodern philosophers adopt the Sophist stand point. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&annotation=3901R|p.34]]

>It does not take much for the tenuous gossamer web of life to come apart. A stray bullet, a stray chromosome, a stray virus and wanton cellular division - and the flesh is hopelessly ruined. Events strike a very delicate balance; they form frail, fragile, vulnerable configurations and micro connections. They are easy prey to chance and misfortune and mishap. Joy is sustained on a tissue-thin surface, a tissue of flesh. [...] To speak of what happens is to give up looking for the meaning of events, because while events give joy or sorrow, they do not, as a whole have Meaning. While there are numerous meanings in events, there is no meaning to events overall, no overarching meaning which is their point, their logos or telos, their sum and their substance. The sum and substance of events are nothing other than the events themselves. There is no deep structure that sustains what we believe or cherish, what we savor in life, none at least that we know of.'' (Caputo 1993:234-235) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&annotation=3904R|p.34]]

# Socrates
>We have no written records of the ideas of the historical Socrates, any more than we have of Thales. What we do have are the writings of his famous pupil, Plato. Because the dialogues of Plato are the only worthwhile source for the philosophy of Socrates, it is usual to attribute the following ideas to Plato (who used the name “Socrates” as a character in his philosophical dialogues) rather than to Socrates. One of the most striking characteristics one encounters in reading Plato's dialogues is the practice of the Socratic method. In Plato's dialogues, the Socratic method takes the form of a systematic questioning, a search for a defensible (acceptable) definition of a word. Such a definition would give an exact account of the essential nature of the object to which it referred. By “essential” is meant something which is peculiarly central to the object. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=34&annotation=3907R|p.34]]

>This essential then needs to be stated in a way that gives us, in a nutshell, enough information to tell us what that object really is. Socrates suggested no formal rules for arriving at satisfactory definitions. Instead, his approach was the argument of negativity. In other words, he would argue that, merely enumerating instances of, say, “true'' statements could not serve as a definition of justice. Instead, he supposed that, because all true statements were called “true'', there was something they had in common apart from the use of the term “true'' and it was this “something'' that was to be defined or accounted for. Also, Socrates would not accept as a definition a word or phrase that contained, either explicitly or tacitly, the word to be defined because, he claimed, this was circular reasoning. If a suggestion passed these grounds, it was then tested by reasoning. Socrates took the definition as one of the premises (initial assumptions) of the argument, the others being agreed upon, sometimes after yet further consideration. Deductions were then made from this set of premises, and the result might be unsatisfactory either because a contradiction was reached or because a conclusion was drawn which was in conflict with the obvious facts. In either case, it followed that there was something wrong with the premises. Since all of these except the suggested definition had been agreed upon, it had to be the definition itself which was faulty, and which therefore had to be rejected.

<u>Below is an example of the famous Socratic Method</u>:
>1. Why does Socrates ask such a simple question? 
>2. What is the purpose of the ambiguity that Socrates creates? 
>3. At this stage of the argument Laches' definition of courage has changed quite considerably. Do you think it is a better definition? Why? 4. At this point in the argument how would you describe Laches' feelings? If you think he is becoming frustrated, you would be correct. Why would a great teacher like Socrates want to provoke his pupil like this? If you study philosophy, are you comfortable being provoked, or as we might say in a more contemporary image, “pushed out of your comfort zone”?

>Epistemology is the theory or science of the methods or grounds of knowledge. Basically, epistemology wrestles with the question What can I know? Our historical account so far has been an exercise in the practice of the epistemology and metaphysics (What is the fundamental nature of reality?) of the pre-Socratic thinkers. When we turn to Socrates, though, we are introduced to the entire range of philosophical problems from problems concerned with knowledge (epistemology); with underlying reality (metaphysics); with grounds for distinguishing good from evil (ethics); and with grounds and principles upon which laws and states are constituted (political philosophy) [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=38&annotation=3928R|p.38]]

>1. We are incarnated into the physical world of the senses and lose our memory of our prior existence in the world of the Forms. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3931R|p.39]]

>2. We perceive the physical world through our senses but intuitively know that because it is always changing, it only appears real. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3934R|p.39]]

>3. In order to have essential knowledge then we need access to knowledge that is unchanging and eternal which is located in the world of the Forms [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3937R|p.39]]

>4. For the above to happen we need to be able to remember the eternal truth and perfection that existed in the eternal world of the Forms. This can only happen if we spend time being educated by philosophers, spend time in intellectual contemplation and abstain from over indulging our physical appetites [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3940R|p.39]]

>At the heart of Plato's philosophy lies his belief that the ordinary world we know through our five senses cannot be fully real. Plato thought that this world is filled with change and decay (as Heraclitus and Parmenides had shown). But if we can ever be said to know something, that which we know must be true, and always remains true despite changing and deceptive appearances. So unless one adopts the methodic doubt of the Sophists that knowledge is unobtainable, there must be a world of stable and perfect objects behind the changing objects of sense perception. The ultimate task of the philosopher was to explore this world. This was Plato's way of resolving the dilemma faced by the successors of Heraclitus and Parmenides - it was his (and Socrates's) answer to the Sophists. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3943R|p.39]]

>What are the characteristics of Plato's theory of knowledge? Well, basically, he argued that knowledge is inseparable from ethics - knowledge is virtue (arête). “Virtue'' did not have the same meaning for Plato as it does for us. The western concept of virtue comes from the Christian heritage, whether or not we are Christian believers. For the Greeks, arête could not stand on its own as “virtue'' can for us. For them, to be virtuous or to be good was to be virtuous in respect of something or to be good at something. So one would talk of a governing arête (good at governing), or a military arête (good at military affairs). Plato speaks of the arête of dogs and horses, that is, their ability to perform their special function as dogs and horses. Plato reasoned that there must also be a human arete, shown by a person who was good at being a person, that is, at performing specifically human functions. The virtuous person was good at conducting his or her life as a human being. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3946R|p.39]]

>Plato would only accept as knowledge what was completely beyond doubt and necessarily true. What was true but might have been otherwise, that is, what was a contingent, rather than a necessary truth, could only be an object of opinion. At best, this could be held as true belief, never as knowledge. For example, it is necessarily true that circles are round. However, it is only contingently true that balls are round. But one does not know that circles are round merely by looking at circles. The ideas of roundness being identical to circularity are arrived at by rational intuition (see below). One “sees'' this in one's “mind's eye'', as it were. This kind of “seeing'' is very different from visual seeing, for instance. In fact, Plato believed that the bodily senses interfere with the pursuit of knowledge because they naturally lead to feelings and desires and these distort our powers of judgment and infect them with prejudice. Sense perception often misleads us and subjects us to illusion. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3949R|p.39]]

>If we are to know to discover the truth about things we can only do so, said Plato, by gradually ceasing to rely upon the information of our senses and seeking, instead, that which is solely intelligible. A first approximation of examples of these readily available, intelligible items of knowledge are mathematical truths. The Platonic upliftment of thought even in fact becomes mystical. In its pursuit of knowledge, the soul (or mind) withdraws, as it were, from the body, suppresses the passions and desires to which the body gives rise, and confines itself to its special activity, namely, thinking. It is through pure thinking that one achieves wisdom. Wisdom is taken as the ultimate good because thinking and knowing are alleged to be the pure activity of the soul, doing what it can do best and what it can do better than any other agent. Since the philosopher pursues wisdom and truth, the philosopher must keep his soul pure of bodily contamination, from passion and desire and free himself from sensory illusion. The philosopher can never hope to do this completely until he dies, for death is the separation of soul from body. Consequently, said Plato, the philosopher will welcome, rather than fear, death (Stumpf & Abel 2002:265-271).

>It was suggested above that one does not know that circles are round merely by looking. How do we determine what the real size and shape of bodies are? In the case of size, do we not rely upon measurement? But measurement requires the precise comparison of quantities, something which our senses cannot do. Furthermore, mere comparison is not enough we need to adopt precise units and count them. So we must use numbers. But these are not objects of sense perception. The notion of unity is purely ideal. We can, no doubt, apply it to whatever sensory object we please we may use any convenient quantity or thing as a unit (consider, for instance, the way we teach children arithmetic). But what a unit is, as such, we can never perceive directly. Unity is purely conceptual. 
>
>Likewise, shape and the precise determination of shape, involve the use of geometrical concepts such as point, line and curve. Although these can be represented in sensory fashion, we never take the sensory diagram as more than an approximate illustration, nor is it ever completely accurate. Hence the ideas of line, circle, angle, etcetera are all ultimately abstract ideas, never strictly realisable in material media. So perhaps Plato has a point, after all [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=39&annotation=3949R|p.39]]

#### Knowledge and the reality of Forms (Universals)
>In a well-known passage from his book Republic, Plato distinguishes between knowledge and opinion. He argues that knowledge is of the real, but that opinion is only of what seems to be the case but is in some way doubtful, confused or fluctuating, or all three together. Since, by definition, knowledge must imply truth, Plato thinks that the proper object of knowledge is actual reality (what the Greeks called Being). 
>
>Plato then asks what would be the proper object of ignorance, and gives the obvious answer that it would be nothing (Nonbeing). He then makes the assertion that the object of opinion is a combination of being and nonbeing, which he calls Becoming.
>
>For instance, we could say that a boy is a man, yet he is not a man but only a child. To give a precise account of anything that changes continuously we have to make seemingly contradictory statements about it. Or, take another example: no human being adequately represents or embodies what we mean by humanity, yet everyone does in some way represent and embody what we mean by the term. So, here again, we tend to say “it is'' and “it is not'' of the same object. In all such cases Plato thought the object of our awareness is imprecise, uncertain, and indeterminate. We can only have opinions about such matters, never knowledge.

>What is real must be unchanging, absolute, and universal. [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=40&annotation=3955R|p.40]]
