# Comprehensive University Notes: Racism, Philosophy, and Decolonization in South Africa

## 1. Introduction to South Africa's Constitutional Framework and Racial Politics

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 establishes South Africa as a democratic state founded on the values of "non-racialism and non-sexism." Courts have subsequently ruled against "blacks only" organizations as unconstitutional, reflecting a particular interpretation of non-racialism.

The prevailing conception of non-racialism in South Africa aligns with what philosopher Theo David Goldberg terms "anti-racialism" rather than "anti-racism" (Goldberg, 2006). This distinction is crucial as:

- Anti-racialism promotes the removal of racial categories
- Such removal doesn't address historical injustices or dismantle structural privileges
- This approach tacitly preserves the status quo established through colonization
- It paradoxically positions those seeking racial justice as themselves being "racist"

### Historical Context:
1652 marks the beginning of indigenous South Africans' multi-century liberation struggle against European colonization. The prevailing concept of non-racialism has roots in:
- English-speaking settler populations and Cape Liberalism
- An unquestioned "right of conquest" philosophy shared with Afrikaner Nationalism

## 2. Racism and Philosophy in South African Academia

The Critical Philosophy of Race demonstrates that racism is philosophically relevant in two interconnected ways:

1. Western philosophy has been complicit in constructing racist theoretical frameworks
2. Philosophy can assist in understanding the origins, nature, and workings of racial problems

Philosophy cannot be a passive observer in discussions of racism. Charles Mills (1998) attributes philosophy's reluctance to address racism to what he calls "theoretical whiteness" - a conceptual framework that systematically excludes non-white perspectives, which:
- Discourages Black post-graduate students from pursuing academic careers
- Allows problematic perspectives to remain unchallenged
- Contributes to the underrepresentation of racism's victims in South African academic philosophy
- Perpetuates ignorance of African philosophy

## 3. Eurocentrism in South African Universities

### Historical Development:
South African educational institutions were founded by European settlers with specific purposes:
- Initially to maintain connection with European "civilization and culture"
- Cape Colony universities deliberately inculcated English cultural dominance (Phillips, 2003)
- They precisely mimicked European universities, even in architectural details
- Indigenous peoples were admitted only after conquest and dispossession
- Structural poverty forced Africans into the colonizer's employment system
- Western education became necessary for economic survival

### Dual Function of Colonial Education:
1. Provide skilled labor for colonial markets and create consumers
2. "Civilize" (or "humanize") Africans by imposing European culture, language, religion, and values

### Historical Educational Failures:
By 1934, educator Loram noted high dropout and failure rates among indigenous children due to:
- Being forced through courses disconnected from their experience
- Learning subjects foreign to their lived reality
- Being taught in unfamiliar languages
- Finding no meaning or satisfaction in their schoolwork

### Present Reality:
South African universities continue to demonstrate bias and condescension toward "non-European" thought, especially African thought and experience, despite:
- Abundant scholarship from throughout the continent and African diaspora (Mudimbe 1988, Oyewumi 2007, Adiume 2004)
- Notable South African contributions (Magubane 1970, Mafeje 1971, Nolutshungu 1975)

### Academic Ghettoization:
Where African perspectives are included, they are typically:
- Isolated in "African Studies" or "Indigenous Knowledge Systems"
- Treated as specialized subfields rather than integral to core disciplines
- Implicitly positioned as non-standard, with non-African subjects treated as universal
- Perpetuating doubt about the quality and value of African knowledge

This pattern reinforces universities *in* Africa rather than truly *African* universities.

## 4. Philosophical Traditions in South Africa

### Historical Context:
Mabogo More argues that apartheid (formally established 1948) was merely the juridical specification of colonial racism that began in 1652, noting: "the name 'apartheid' emerged as a means of strengthening and perfecting an already existing system of racial discrimination."

Two basic colonial traditions have shaped South African philosophy:
1. Dutch (Afrikaans-Continental)
2. British (Anglo-Saxon)

### The Afrikaans-Continental Tradition:

- Began mid-19th century at Stellenbosch theological school
- Expanded to universities in Orange Free State, Pretoria, and Potchefstroom
- Early scholars like Dr. W.A. Macfayden introduced elements that would become apartheid ideology
- Characterized by a blend of continental philosophy and Protestant theology
- Drew heavily from Calvinist and Neo-Fichtean traditions
- Many philosophers studied under European thinkers like Schelling, Herder, and Fichte
- Adapted concepts from Fichte to justify racial separation
- Explicitly defended apartheid after 1948 using various philosophical approaches
- Misused Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology to develop apartheid education philosophy (*Fundamentiele Pedagogie*)
- Strongly influenced by the Afrikaner secret society Broederbond, which controlled education

**Key Figure: Nico Diederichs**
- First vice-chancellor of Rand Afrikaans Universiteit (later University of Johannesburg)
- Finance Minister and State President (1975)
- Chair of political philosophy at University of the Orange Free State
- Developed social metaphysics opposing human equality
- Argued that individual fulfillment was only possible through devotion to the nation
- Claimed some people are "more human" than others based on their spiritual development
  
**Another Notable Figure: Herman de Vleeschauwer**
- Kant specialist and Chair of Philosophy at University of South Africa (1951-1965)
- Escaped convict for Nazi war crimes committed during German occupation of Belgium

### The Anglo-Saxon Tradition:

- Began at University of the Cape of Good Hope (1873)
- R.F.A. Hoernl√© was a major figure in South African liberalism
- At University of Witwatersrand, emphasized liberalism in multiracial society
- Advocated racial separation rather than assimilation in his 1939 work

Both traditions were used to justify racial discrimination before and during apartheid.

#### The "Neutralist Position":
Analytic philosophers claimed that:
- Philosophy should be pursued for its own sake
- It should not involve itself in social and political issues
- Philosophy is a second-order activity concerned with logical analysis of concepts
- Social and political issues aren't the task of the philosopher qua philosopher

**Case Study: Professor Andrew Howson Murray (UCT, 1937-1970)**
- Collaborated with the apartheid regime
- Promoted "pluralism" as an apology for apartheid
- Served as the state's anti-communist expert witness in the Treason Trial
- Worked for the Publications Appeal Board (censorship body)
- Recommended authors be investigated by military intelligence

## 5. Liberalism and African Politics

- Liberalism has been predominantly associated with English-speaking South Africa
- Has faced rejection from African political movements
- The ANC Youth League under Anton Lembede criticized liberals as "trustees stifling African political development"
- Liberals were viewed as hypocrites who enjoyed moral reputation for rejecting white supremacy while benefiting from it

## 6. The Struggle Continues

Despite constitutional changes, the struggle for authentic political liberation and economic freedom continues in South Africa, as racial categories and their historical consequences remain contested.

The post-apartheid era has seen the rise of decolonial thought in South African universities, culminating in the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall movements beginning in 2015. These student-led protests called for curriculum transformation, removal of colonial symbols, and addressing economic barriers to education. The tensions described in these notes continue to shape contemporary debates about transformation in higher education and the role of philosophy in addressing historical injustices.
