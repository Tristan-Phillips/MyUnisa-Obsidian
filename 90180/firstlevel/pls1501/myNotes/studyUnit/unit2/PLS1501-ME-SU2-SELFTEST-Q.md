>We suggest you treat these questions as a kind of revision exercise. Please note that many of them are not intended to be examples of questions which may be set in your examinations. Instead, they should be regarded as drawing attention to parts of the study material which require further consolidation and reflection. After formulating your responses to these questions, you should be in a better position to develop your ideas in the systematic manner required to answer the longer, essay-type examination questions. You will receive some examples of examination questions in the follow-up tutorial letters which will be sent to you some time after the assignment closing dates [[PLS1501-TUT-2023-501.pdf#page=57&annotation=4283R|p.57]]
