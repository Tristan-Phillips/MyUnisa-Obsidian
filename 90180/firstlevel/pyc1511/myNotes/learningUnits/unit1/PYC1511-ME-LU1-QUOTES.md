# Introduction
>This unit will provide an introduction  to  the origins of psychology,  including the geographic locations that informed how it was conceptualised, the different areas and theories that inform its development and,  lastly, the role of psychology in colonisation and racism  on the African continent [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=1&annotation=866R|p.1]]

## The origin of psychology in Africa
>Although psychology has been part of African society, the content and orientation of psychology as a professional discipline are Euro-American imports (Oppong et al., 2014) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=869R|p.2]]

>According to Nsamenang (2007), Euro-American psychology was  introduced  to  Africa  during  the  colonial  period  partly  through  Christian missionaries, visiting Western psychologists  and  Africans who were returning from universities abroad after being trained in conventional Western psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=872R|p.2]]

>Christian missionaries, according to Nsamenang, introduced the teaching of  mainstream Western psychology in the philosophy training curriculum that was intended for the education of African candidates for theology and the priesthood.  From this world view, psychology is defined as the study of  thought, emotions and observed behaviour (APA,  2015) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=875R|p.2]]

>Psychology’s connotation of being scientific  gives the discipline power and authority over the human experience (Bohmke & Tlali, 2008)  since  it  claims to  have  the power to declare what behaviours are considered normal  and  adaptive. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=878R|p.2]]

>Nwoye (2015a, p. 104) defines psychology as the “systematic and informed study of the complexities of human mental life, culture and experience in the pre-  and post-colonial African world” [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=881R|p.2]]

>Universities in Africa  were established  following  Africa’s colonial contact with Europe. Most of them started in the 1960s  and 1970s  after  colonised  countries  gained political independence  from  their  former  colonisers [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=884R|p.2]]

>Some of  the  universities,  like the  University  of Ibadan (Nigeria),  the  University  of  Ghana  (Ghana),  the  University  of  Dar  es  Salaam (Tanzania), Makerere  University  (Uganda) and  the University of  Nairobi (Kenya), started as offshore  colleges of the University of London, initially flying the flag of their “mother university”  and offering  various  courses  (including  psychology)  that were developed abroad and imported to Africa. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=887R|p.2]]

>In those early years (that is,  the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s, and indeed up  until  today), most nations of Africa, like other non-Western countries,  such as China, India, Iran and  the  Philippines,  did not have a fully articulated, scientific psychology of their own (Nwoye, 2022). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=890R|p.2]]

>there was an inability to recognise and admit that there was something worthwhile, psychologically, out there in  other regions, beyond the traditional location of the European cultural and psychological tradition (Danziger, 2006) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=2&annotation=893R|p.2]]

# Task 1: Colonialism and psychology
a. In 1960, 17 African  countries declared  their  independence.  Watch  the following video by  The  New York Times  in this regard: [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=896R|p.3]]
[Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/learning/lesson-of-the-day-a-continent-remade.html)

b. How would you summarise these  events? Tell someone about this video [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=899R|p.3]]

c. Do you believe that when African countries became independent,  colonialism ended, or are there other forms  of  colonisation that  persist to  this day? [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=902R|p.3]]

---
>This generated the need for persistent importation and transplantation of Euro-American psychologies (Danziger, 2006) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=905R|p.3]]

>In that way, the formal study of psychology in African universities emerged as a subordinated,  dependent  and  Westernised  psychology. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=908R|p.3]]

>African  psychologists  in continental Africa, overdetermined by the Eurocentric story of what psychology is about, have for years ended up in disappointment and traumatic bewilderment regarding how to break away from the restricted boundaries this tradition set for the study of psychology in Africa  (Benjamin-Bullock & Seabi, 2013). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=911R|p.3]]

>The dominance of the Western world  view  has  defined  what constitutes the study of psychology,  and  the way in  which  its sub-disciplines  are  divided  is inextricably linked to how Western countries have historically oppressed people from Africa. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=914R|p.3]]

>This oppression finds expression through colonisation and imperialism. In other words,  the way in which  psychology is defined,  as well as  the emphasis on its  “scientific”  quality, is not necessarily divorced from history and politics of oppression (Bohmke & Tlali, 2008) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=922R|p.3]]

# Psychology and location
>The word  “psychology”  is  derived  from Greek. The first part of the word  comes from the Greek  psychē,  which refers to the soul;  the second part  comes from the Greek [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=3&annotation=925R|p.3]] logos, which refers to  studying  a particular subject. Based on the etymology of the word (i.e., the origin and historical development of the meaning of  the  word),  it could be concluded that psychology is the study of the soul. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=928R|p.4]]

>The first critical issue  is  that  people’s location  often determines their world  view [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=931R|p.4]]

>A world  view can be defined as a set of presumptions that particular people have about the world. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=934R|p.4]]

>how people  in places like Greece  think about and see the world will most likely differ  from  how people  from  Africa and other  continents see and  think about the world [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=937R|p.4]]

>This  concept  is  referred to  as  epistemic location [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=940R|p.4]]

>In terms of this concept,  people generate their world  views from a particular  geopolitical  context and  qualify  truths  based  on  their  positioning  (Mignolo,  2002) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=943R|p.4]]

>Consequently, psychology is not  value  free  but  is informed by a cultural reference. In the same breath, Grosfoguel (2013) questions  why disciplines such as  psychology are based on ideas and theories only from  Western nations,  thus  questioning  the contextual relevance and applicability of such theories in non-Western contexts. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=946R|p.4]]

>The second critical point to examine is the idea of science informing the study of psychology. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=949R|p.4]]

>Science  in psychology  implies a couple of things about the human psyche. It implies, for instance,  that human behaviour, emotions  and thought can be studied objectively. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=952R|p.4]]

>it can lead  people  to think about human  beings  in a  mechanical  way  as though  no other factors  contribute to human behaviour and may not reflect the complexities of society  in  informing human behaviour. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=955R|p.4]]

>The third issue relates to  the following questions: Who decides  what human  processes are  within  the  scope  of  psychology  to  study? [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=958R|p.4]]

>psychology has perpetuated reason,  intelligence and behaviour  as the ideal measures of  human  functioning, mental health and  civilisation. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=4&annotation=961R|p.4]]

# Psychology in Egypt
>Three significant events occurred in the  19th  century that influenced the  rise  of psychology in Egypt  (Ahmed, 1992) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=964R|p.5]]

>Firstly,  the Al-Abssia Mental Health Hospital, the first mental hospital for Africa and the Arab world,  was  opened in Cairo in 1880 [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=967R|p.5]]

>Secondly,  the  newspapers and magazines  distributed to the public paved the way for psychology in Egypt. These newspapers  and  magazines  were established in Cairo and Alexandria, primarily by a group of immigrant Lebanese and Syrian journalists (Ahmed, 2005). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=970R|p.5]]

>Lastly, Egypt started to expand its schooling system by establishing schools all over the country, including teachers’ schools, whose curriculum included some  basic  psychology  training. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=973R|p.5]]

>In Cairo, the term  “psychology” first appeared in a curriculum approved by the Ministry of Education in 1906. Since 1908,  the  Philosophy  Department at Cairo University has included psychology courses in its curriculum. After the establishment of the Higher  Institute for Education in Cairo in 1929, psychology became known as a distinguished scientific discipline  (Soueif & Ahmed, 2001). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=976R|p.5]]

# Psychology in South Africa
>Psychology has  a noble purpose.  However,  in South Africa,  it became perverted to fulfil  a political purpose. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=979R|p.5]]

>As Marx (2013)  notes, it was believed that  the  Bantu  were  not simply less developed than Europeans; rather,  the belief was that  their culture differed fundamentally from European culture and  was  incompatible with it [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=982R|p.5]]

>The logical conclusion  was  that  mixing  cultures would be as fatal for indigenous Africans as it would be for whites; the only possible solution  was  total separation in the form of apartheid. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=985R|p.5]]

>Higher education in South Africa can be traced back to 1829,  when the South African College (later  the  University of Cape Town) was established in Cape Town (Cooper & Nicholas, 2012). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=988R|p.5]]

>In 1873,  the University of Good Hope was established as an examining body for degrees conferred in South Africa. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=991R|p.5]]

>In 1916,  the University Act of South Africa  launched  the University of South Africa, the University of Stellenbosch and the South African Native College (later  the University  Fort Hare). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=5&annotation=994R|p.5]]

>Psychology was taught in philosophy departments until 1917. RW Wilcocks (1892– 1967) was appointed as Professor of Logic and Psychology at the University of Stellenbosch after he  had  received his doctorate  in  the analysis of productive thought at the University of Berlin in 1917. He established the first experimental psychology laboratory  modelled  on  Wundt’s laboratory  at the University of Stellenbosch (Louw & Foster, 1991) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=997R|p.6]]

>Psychology in South Africa was  used to  perpetuate  racism  and oppression of the  black majority.  White psychologists,  such as EG Malherbe, JC Smuts, RW Wilcocks, HF Verwoerd and S Biesheuvel,  played a significant role in the creation of apartheid and its policies. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1000R|p.6]]

>Nonetheless,  other  psychologists  protested  against the unjust ways  in which  psychology  perpetuated  racism. Chabani N Manganyi  became the first black psychologist in  1965 and established the  Department of  Psychology at the University of Transkei  in 1976  (now  Walter Sisulu University). Josephine Naidoo was the first black person to apply for  South African Psychological Association membership. Sathasivan  Cooper,  who frequently met with political activists,  such as Steve Biko, Harry Nengwekhulu  and  Strini Moodley,  helped to  establish the  Black Consciousness philosophy and was instrumental in the formation of the  student’s  representative council (SRC) at the University College.  His political ideologies later led  to his suspension from university in 1969.  He steered  the  merger  with the University of Natal to form what is now known as the University of KwaZulu-Natal [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1003R|p.6]]

# Psychology in Zambia
>Psychology  emerged  in  Zambia  during  colonialism  within  the  context  of anthropological research to serve colonial  British  interests. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1006R|p.6]]

>The history of social anthropology goes back to the mid-thirties with the establishment of the Rhodes- Livingstone  Institute  in  1937  (Peltzer  &  Bless,  1989). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1009R|p.6]]

>A  major  development  of psychology was the appointment of a British psychologist, Prof A Heron, as director of the Institute in 1963. He founded  the  Human Development Research Unit at the Institute for Social Research to study  perceptual development in African children and young adults. These  studies were carried out in the laboratory,  in  family  settings  and in  schools.  The  Institute  for  Social  Research  also  worked  on  educational  and occupational  selection.  This  work  was  then  established  permanently  as  the Educational and Occupational Assessment Service under the Ministry of Labour and Social Services. Later,  the mining industry and the Ministry of Higher Education established psychological (assessment) services (Heron, 1967,  as cited in Peltzer & Bless,  1989; Machungwa et al., 1984). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1012R|p.6]]

>In 1965,  the first laboratory for research in experimental psychology was established in Zambia (Nsamenang, 2007).  In addition, one of the first psychology departments in East and Southern Africa was founded at the  University of Zambia in 1968. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=6&annotation=1015R|p.6]]

>basic  research  was  required  because  Western techniques were not always appropriate for the African context  (Heron, 1967, as cited in Peltzer & Bless, 1989). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1018R|p.7]]

>For example, in a study of reasoning in specific non- language-based school examination tasks, it was discovered that poor performance in the tasks was related to socio-economic background and thus to familiarity with and acquired skills in dealing with the information presented as pictures (Okonji, 1971). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1021R|p.7]]

>the  “how”  and  the “where”  that inform the definition of psychology  are  crucial to how the  study  of psychology becomes an extension of oppressive  political  systems  like  colonisation,  apartheid  and  imperialism. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1029R|p.7]]

>When psychology  is used to  justify  the oppression of  one race by  another,  it becomes  a  tool that aids  oppressive regimes  and maintains  the status quo. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1032R|p.7]]

# Task 2: Finding your psychology
>a. Go out into your community and ask five people what psychology means to them.  Share what these  people  said  about psychology  on your e-tutor group site on  myUnisa [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1035R|p.7]]

>b. Do you agree or disagree with these people’s  views  of  psychology,  and why? [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1038R|p.7]]

>c. Reflect on the underlying world  views that inform people’s definition of psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1041R|p.7]]

# The different areas in the development of psychology in Africa
>Psychology as a discipline is concerned with the mind and  behaviour (Holt et al., 2019) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1044R|p.7]]

>The mind,  in this instance,  refers to internal processes such as cognition or emotional states, whereas behaviour refers to the outward manner  in which  these inward processes manifest. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1047R|p.7]]

>Basic,  or  general, psychology  is the study of the different factors  that shape an individual’s personality, learning, cognition  and so forth. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1050R|p.7]]

>Basic psychology  includes  abnormal  psychology,  behaviourism,  biological  psychology, cognitive  psychology,  comparative  psychology,  cross-cultural  psychology, developmental  psychology,  evolutionary  psychology,  experimental  psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=7&annotation=1053R|p.7]] neuropsychology,  personality  psychology,  positive  psychology,  psychodynamic psychology, quantitative  psychology  and social psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1056R|p.8]]

>Abnormal psychology  is a branch of psychology  that  studies unusual patterns of behaviour, emotion and thought considered to be maladaptive and disruptive to an individual’s life [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1059R|p.8]]

>Psychopathology,  which is similar to abnormal psychology,  refers to the study of mental illness,  mainly by psychologists and psychiatrists to reach a medical understanding of the disease process [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1062R|p.8]]

>There are mainly three historical phases  of  development,  namely,  demonology  (i.e.,  caused  by  evil  forces), somatogenesis (i.e., bodily causes) and psychogenesis (i.e., psychological or mental causes). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1065R|p.8]]

>Demonology is the theory that the devil or another evil entity  can  reside inside a person and exert  a  mental influence over that person. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1068R|p.8]]

>Examples of demonological beliefs can be traced  to  Chinese, Egyptian,  Babylonian and Greek  records.  There was a  belief that abnormal behaviour was caused by evil spirits,  which had  to be cast out through ritualistic chanting or torture, also known as exorcism [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1071R|p.8]]

>In the fifth century  BC, Hippocrates (460–377) rejected the Greek  belief that the gods sent serious physical diseases and mental disturbances as punishment.  He believed that illnesses were caused naturally. He is considered a pioneer of somatogenesis, which states that something wrong with the soma, or the physical body,  disturbs thoughts and actions. (This  is  in  contrast  with  psychogenesis,  which  states  that  a  disturbance  has psychological  origins.). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1074R|p.8]]

>Hippocrates  classified  mental  disorders  into  mania, melancholia and phrenitis, or brain fever. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1077R|p.8]]

>He believed that normal brain functioning, also known as mental health, depended on a delicate balance of four main fluids in the body: blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1080R|p.8]]

>For example, a phlegm imbalance resulted in a person feeling sluggish and dull. Black bile resulted in  melancholia and too much yellow bile resulted in irritability and anxiousness. His documented work led to information that is used to identify symptoms of epilepsy, alcoholic delusion, stroke and paranoia (Davidson  et al., 2004, p.  7) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1083R|p.8]]

>Lunacy trials were held in England  in the 13th  century  to  determine  individuals’  sanity.  However,  the  individuals’  strange behaviour was  due  to  injury, physical illness  or  emotional shock and  was  not necessarily  caused by  demonic  possession. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1086R|p.8]]

>In the  15th century, there  were few mental hospitals.  Most hospitals were used for the treatment of leprosy (Davidson et al., 2004). These facilities were converted to asylums around 1547 in England. Patients who were admitted  to  these types of hospitals were seen as a burden to society and locked  away  in  desolate  circumstances. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1089R|p.8]]

>In  1883,  Emil  Kraepelin  (1856–1926) published a classification system that could be used to establish the biological nature of mental illness. He discerned among mental disorders a tendency for certain groups of  symptoms,  or  syndromes,  to  appear  together,  which  could consequently  be regarded  as  underlying physical causes  of  particular medical diseases. He regarded each mental illness  as  distinct from others, having its own origins, symptoms, course and outcome. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1092R|p.8]]

>other researchers, especially in France and Austria, attributed mental disorders to psychological malfunction [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1095R|p.8]]

>Franz Anton  Mesmer (1734–1815),  an Austrian physician practising in Vienna [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=8&annotation=1098R|p.8]] who  was  one  of  the  earliest  practitioners  of  modern-day  hypnosis.  The  word “mesmerise”  is an older term  for “hypnotise”  (Davidson et al., 2004). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1101R|p.9]]

>The history of abnormal behaviour in  Africa can be traced to Kenya. In 1934,  HL Gordon,  who was one of the most senior physicians in the colony and  the  author of many papers presented to the Kenyan branch of the British Medical Association in Nairobi, reported on the African mind in the  Journal of Mental Science  while studying patients admitted at the Mathari Mental Hospital, Kenya (McCulloch, 1995, p.  46. According to Gordon, “the African had no regard for the sanctity of life, no sense of decency; and by European standards, was simply abnormal” (Nwoye, 2022) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1104R|p.9]]

>Behaviourism  dominated psychology between 1920 and the 1950s [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1107R|p.9]]

>According to behaviourism,  all things that organisms do  –  including acting, thinking and feeling  – can and should be regarded as behaviour and psychological disorders are best treated by altering behaviour patterns or modifying the environment. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1110R|p.9]]

>Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) was one of the pioneers of behaviourism. Pavlov, a Russian physiologist,  carried out studies on the function of heart nerves, primary digestive glands and conditioned responses, that is,  classical conditioning [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1113R|p.9]]

>His studies on primary digestive glands accidentally showed results of conditioned responses. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1121R|p.9]]

>While doing research about the function  of  juices  secreted by dogs  when given food,  he noticed that dogs began  to salivate  even when they were not  waiting for food. Dogs would  salivate  on seeing their keepers or even hearing their keepers’ footsteps. Pavlov found that dogs’  reflexes were  stirred  by other events happening at the same time  as  the real stimulus. Pavlov was interested in behaviour displayed by organisms against stimulus [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1124R|p.9]]

>In 1913,  John Broadus Watson (1878–1958) wrote an article,  “Psychology through the eyes of a behaviourist”,  in which he  stated that the science of psychology deals with observable behaviours and not phenomena such as conscience or thought. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1127R|p.9]]

>It was only after Watson’s article that behaviourism was delineated into three phases. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1130R|p.9]]

>The first phase, namely,  Watson’s behaviourism lasted until 1930. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1133R|p.9]]

>The second phase,  namely, new-behaviourism comprised  studies by Edward Tolman, Edwin Guthrie, Clark Hull and BF Skinner  and  lasted until  the  1960s [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1136R|p.9]]

>In this phase,  behaviourists claimed that (a) the base of psychology was composed of  studies about learning, (b) behaviours could be explained by principles of conditioning and (c) psychology had to comply with the principle of functionalism and if a concept could not be defined functionally,  it could not  be  studied either. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1139R|p.9]]

>The third phase, called new-new behaviourism or social behaviourism,  included cognitive elements. This phase was pioneered by Bandura and Rotter. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1142R|p.9]]

>There are two general kinds of behaviourists, namely,  radical (e.g., Watson and Skinner) and methodological  (e.g.,  Bandura  and  Rotter)  behaviourists. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1145R|p.9]]

>Radical  behaviourists believe that psychology should study observable behaviours  and  environmental [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=9&annotation=1148R|p.9]] processes,  while  methodological  behaviourists  believe  that  cognitive  processes should be included when studying methods of behaviour.

>Biological psychology, or biopsychology, specialises in the mind–body connection, especially how the nervous system affects behaviour (Britannica, 2020) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=10&annotation=1154R|p.10]]

>It  came into being in 1913,  following researcher Hideyo Noguchi’s discovery of the bacterium responsible for syphilis in the brain of a deceased patient.

>Developmental psychology as a discipline started as a philosophical field with John Locke (1632– 1704) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=11&annotation=1177R|p.11]]

>Rousseau was the first to argue that a child grows in stages. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=11&annotation=1183R|p.11]]

>Evolutionary  psychology  explains traits and processes such as memory, perception and  language in terms of humans having to adapt to  an  evolving environment. Historically,  Charles Darwin’s (1809–1882) theory of natural selection provides the basis for  an understanding of  evolution [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1186R|p.12]]

>Experimental psychology  represents a methodological approach to psychology and refers to the use of experiments to understand human and animal participants’ sensation,  perception,  memory,  cognition,  learning,  motivation,  emotion  and developmental processes, as well as  social issues. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1189R|p.12]]

>Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) founded the first laboratory  for experimental psychology  in Leipzig, Germany. Charles Bell (1774–1842),  a British physiologist,  did research on the nervous system and Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878),  a German physicist,  suggested that judgements of sensory differences are relative,  not absolute.  This led to Weber’s  law,  which is considered the first quantitative law in the history of psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1192R|p.12]]

>Neuropsychology  involves the study of the structure and  the  functions of the brain in relation to specific psychological processes and overt behaviours (Gluck, Mercado & Meyers, 2016). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1195R|p.12]]

>Although this is  a  recent  textbook, the history of the field can be traced back to the third dynasty of ancient Egypt. Imhotep, an Egyptian priest,  first wrote about a scientific approach to medicine and disease  and  described  the  brain, trauma, abnormalities and remedies (Finger, 2000). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1201R|p.12]]

>Personality psychology  as a field investigates characteristics that all people  have  that shape their thoughts, feelings and behaviour (Young, 2020). The Big 5 personality model is often used to describe individual differences in people. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1204R|p.12]]

>Social psychology  studies social behaviour and mental processes that pertain to social behaviour. It is concerned with how humans think about and relate  to one  another. Social psychologists study topics such as conformity, the effect of  persuasion on human behaviour, beliefs, attitudes and stereotypes [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=12&annotation=1207R|p.12]]

# Different theoretical perspectives in the development of psychology in Africa
>The beginning of psychological work in Africa  can be traced back to  research done by missionaries, explorers,  anthropologists  and colonial administrators  (Oppong  et al., 2013). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=13&annotation=1210R|p.13]]

>The  results  (which  were often biased,  called  “scientific racism”)  were  grounded in  factors that sought to distinguish racial differences between Africans and Euro- Americans. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=13&annotation=1213R|p.13]]

>The training  of practising psychologists in Africa failed to fully account for the lived realities of African people and  provided an inaccurate representation of African reality, and Africans struggled to incorporate or  to  find relevance in the training in their immediate socio-cultural  contexts  (Oppong, 2022) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=13&annotation=1216R|p.13]]

>Bulhan (1985)  identifies  the following three ways in which Eurocentric psychology continued  to manifest itself [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=14&annotation=1219R|p.14]]

>1) Assumptive  solipsism.  Assumptive solipsism  is  the assumption that  the Euro- American world  view is the only  or  most significant world  view. 
>2) Methodological  solipsism.  Methodological  solipsism  is  the  assumption  that positivism or neo-positivism is the only or best way to conduct scientific research.
>3) Experiential solipsism.  Experiential solipsism  is the assumption that  middle-class white  men’s  experiences are the most valid [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=14&annotation=1222R|p.14]]

>These  assumptions  make up the foundation of Eurocentric psychology [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=14&annotation=1225R|p.14]]

>The  assumptive  solipsism  of Eurocentric psychology continues to function in South African psychology in the form of biases (Bulhan, 1985). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=14&annotation=1228R|p.14]]

>The solipsism  described  above could be seen in the obsession with psychometric testing as an area of development. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=15&annotation=1231R|p.15]]

>Tests  developed in America or Europe were used and standardised. They were seen as  universal and  were  mainly  used for testing  blacks, Indians, coloureds and  whites  with a view  to making  racial comparisons [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=15&annotation=1234R|p.15]]

>Some of the scales used included the Official Mental Hygiene Individual Scale (also known as the Fick Scale), published in 1926 by Martin Laurence Fick (1898–1945),  which was the first South African  intelligence  test. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=15&annotation=1237R|p.15]]

>Other  intelligence  tests  included  the  Stanford–Binet Intelligence  Scale (originally published in 1916),  which tests intelligence across six areas,  namely,  general  intelligence,  knowledge,  fluid  reasoning,  quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing and working memory [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=15&annotation=1240R|p.15]]

# The role of psychology in colonization and racial segregation
>The discipline of psychology did not,  of course,  emerge in a social vacuum unrelated to Europe’s history of conquest and  violence.  From  its  beginning  to  the  present,  the discipline has been  entangled  in that history of conquest and  violence.  This  fact  is  often  unappreciated  and conveniently avoided. Yet  for a discipline known for its commitment  to  unmasking  the  repressed  and  for  its profusion of studies, such neglect and avoidance of human history and role of  the  psychologist in that history is curious indeed  (Bulhan, 1985, p. 37) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=18&annotation=1246R|p.18]]

>In fact, psychology began to form in all those practical locales that took shape across the 19th century where problems of human individual and collective conduct were of concern to those authorities who sought to govern them –  in the factory, the prison, the army, the schoolroom, and the courtroom.  Psychology initially  took shape, not so much as a discipline but as a mode of expertise, an array of knowledge  claims  about  persons,  individually  and collectively, that would enable them to be better managed (Rose, 1988, p. 448). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=19&annotation=1249R|p.19]]

>As such,  the role of psychology is to provide  governments  with  vocabulary, information and regulatory techniques,  particularly in  relation to  the identification of  the mentally ill,  the  management  of  disabled children and  the  management  of  racial classification [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=19&annotation=1252R|p.19]]

>Apartheid  was  a formalised system of racial segregation and oppression  in South Africa.  Powerful institutions,  such as the courts, parliament and law enforcement,  worked together to ensure that different races in South Africa lived separately and that  white people  enjoyed material, social and spiritual freedom. In contrast,  black  South Africans were subjected to oppression in all forms  of  life. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=20&annotation=1255R|p.20]]

>Colonisation  and  apartheid  are  similar,  but  colonisation  predates apartheid. Colonisation is a system of oppression where a settler group invades a territory  occupied  by  indigenous  people  and  systematically  exploits  them economically, culturally,  politically  and psychologically.  Colonialism is much more than just capturing land; it  is the domination  of indigenous people  by foreign  people (Bulhan, 2015) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=20&annotation=1258R|p.20]]

>It entails the economic exploitation of a country, the elimination of cultures and the degradation of  the country’s  inhabitants to  less-than-human entities.  It stands for the manipulation of the mind of the oppressed, giving them the perception that their ways of living and thinking are inferior and that the only way to  civilisation  is through westernisation  (Bulhan, 2015) [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=20&annotation=1261R|p.20]]

>Slavery ended, but  racism, self-promotion and a sense of superiority  did not. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=21&annotation=1264R|p.21]]

>Psychology as  a discipline  was  co-opted by the colonial and apartheid regime to meet  its  political ends. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=21&annotation=1267R|p.21]]

The following individuals are worth mentioning as role players who shaped the history of psychology in South Africa:
>- Ernst Gideon Malherbe (1896–1983) occupied various  high-profile  positions.  His role in the poor white study and  his views on  psychology’s  role  in  society made him a  prominent  figure. 
>- Jan Christian Smuts (1870–1950)  was a psychologist and a lawyer and  served as the  prime minister of  South Africa from 1919 to 1924 and again from 1939 to 1948 (Nicholas, 2014). Smuts  made significant contributions to  the  development  of government policies, including the Mines and Works Act of 1911 and the Native Land Act of 1913. 
>- Raymond  William  Wilcocks  (1892–1967)  joined  Malherbe  in  large-scale psychometric testing of poor  whites in the 1930s. 
>- Hendrik Frensch  Verwoerd  (1901–1966)  graduated from Stellenbosch University in 1936 with a PhD in Psychology, around the same time that Wilcocks was there and working on the  poor  white  study. Given the close relationship that Wilcocks and Verwoerd seem to have had, it is not surprising that  they  had  similar views regarding race relations in South Africa  (Miller,  1993). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=22&annotation=1270R|p.22]]

# The role of psychological associations and research institutes in South Africa
>The military and industry began using psychology’s knowledge base for their ends. The  South African Air Force  (SAAF), the National Institute for Personnel Research (NIPR), the National Commission of Education and the South African Association for the Advancement of Science (SAAAS) all produced psychological knowledge that justified the oppression of  black South Africans. The NIPR was established shortly after World War  II  under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). It was introduced by the government and businesses to improve productivity and  to reduce industrial action  among the workforce (Seedat & Mackenzie, 2008). [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=22&annotation=1273R|p.22]]

Summary of important developments in respect of research institutes and associations in South Africa:
>- A unit called the Aptitude Test Section was established  in  the South African Air Force. 
>- Psychologists at the ATS were recruited from the then Transvaal University College,  which  split  into  the  University  of  the  Witwatersrand  and  the University of Pretoria. 
>- The National Institute for Personnel Research was established to prevent labour unrest and  to  improve production [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=23&annotation=1276R|p.23]]

>According to Holdstock (2000), the lives of the black population are virtually untouched by any positive benefits that may accrue from the practice of psychology as a science and a profession. [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=23&annotation=1279R|p.23]]

>The emphasis is on one-to-one therapy rather than group and community approaches. Despite the advances made by black psychologists in gaining a foothold in the professional body of psychology in the country,  psychology  continues to be Westrocentric [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=23&annotation=1282R|p.23]]

# Summary
>This unit  introduced  you  to  the origin of psychology in Africa  and  how  the European models of psychology have shaped psychology  on  the African continent.  The unit also dealt with  the different areas in the development of  psychology in Africa,  as well as  the different theoretical perspectives in the development of psychology in Africa  that emanated  from  different regions across the continent.  The role of psychology in colonisation and racial segregation  was  emphasised  in  a discussion on key figures who advocated  the use of psychology to enforce racial  oppression. The unit also examined  how other key figures in the  discipline  of psychology resisted oppression through  advocacy  of  a  psychology  that  is  context  relevant,  responsive,  non- discriminatory  and sensitive to issues of African people [[PYC1511-2025-LU-1.pdf#page=24&annotation=1285R|p.24]]
